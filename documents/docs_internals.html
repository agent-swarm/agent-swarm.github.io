<p><strong>Overall Architecture:</strong></p>
<p>This system built around a distributed, asynchronous architecture. Agents communicate via a message queue, and their interactions are orchestrated through a series of tools and processes. The core concept is to allow agents to perform tasks independently while still being part of a larger, coordinated system.</p>
<p><strong>Core Concepts &amp; Relationships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swarm Orchestration:</strong> The entire framework is built around orchestrating agents to perform tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Agent as the Central Unit:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> is the fundamental building block – the individual agent that executes tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Communication (Bus):</strong> The <code>IAgentParams</code> interface highlights the importance of the <code>bus</code> (a messaging system) for agents to communicate and coordinate.</li>
<li><strong>History Management:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> and <code>IAgentParams</code> emphasize the agent's ability to operate without relying on conversation history (using the <code>run</code> method).</li>
<li><strong>Tool Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>call</code> and <code>execute</code> methods are central to running tools within the agent.</li>
<li><strong>Schema &amp; Configuration:</strong> The <code>IAgentSchema</code> defines the configuration for each agent, including its tools, prompt, and completion mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interface Breakdown &amp; Key Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a summary of each interface and its role:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>IAgent</code>:</strong> The core runtime agent.  Handles independent execution, tool calls, message commitment, and lifecycle management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentParams</code>:</strong>  Provides the agent with the necessary parameters for operation, including its ID, logging, communication channel, and history management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchema</code>:</strong> Defines the configuration settings for an agent (tools, prompt, completion mechanism).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchemaCallbacks</code>:</strong>  Provides callbacks for managing different stages of an agent’s lifecycle (init, run, output, etc.).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentConnectionService</code>:</strong> A type definition for an <code>AgentConnectionService</code> – a service that manages connections between the agents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Workflow Implications</strong></p>
<p>Based on these interfaces, here’s a workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Agent Configuration:</strong> An <code>IAgentSchema</code> is created to define the agent’s settings.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Instantiation:</strong> An <code>IAgent</code> instance is created based on the schema.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>execute</code> method is called to initiate independent operation.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Calls:</strong>  The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>call</code> to execute tools.</li>
<li><strong>Message Handling:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>commitToolOutput</code>, <code>commitSystemMessage</code>, and <code>commitUserMessage</code> to manage messages.</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses the <code>bus</code> (via <code>IAgentParams</code>) to communicate with other agents.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key Concepts &amp; Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> Agents maintain their own state (conversation history, tool outputs, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Decoupling:</strong> The interfaces are designed to decouple different components of the system. This allows for flexibility and easier maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Event-Driven Architecture:</strong> The use of callbacks suggests an event-driven architecture, where components communicate through events rather than direct calls.</li>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> The interfaces highlight the importance of managing the agent's state, including conversation history, tool output, and system messages.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Integration:</strong> The <code>tools</code> property in <code>IAgentParams</code> indicates a system designed to integrate with external tools.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous Communication:</strong> Agents communicate asynchronously via a bus, allowing them to operate independently.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The system is designed to be flexible, a</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Use Cases:</strong></p>
<p>This architecture could be used for a wide range of applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chatbots:</strong>  Agents could be used to power conversational AI systems.</li>
<li><strong>Content Generation:</strong> Agents could be used to generate text, images, or other content.</li>
<li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Agents could be used to analyze data and generate insights.</li>

It’s designed to be safe to run repeatedly – it won't cause any problems if you run it multiple times because it only validates once per process. Think of it as a health check for your AI agent setup.</p>
<a id="function-startpipeline" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function startPipeline<a href="#function-startpipeline" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you kick off a sequence of tasks, or a &quot;pipeline,&quot; within your AI agent swarm. You tell it which client is requesting the work, what pipeline you want to run (like &quot;data analysis&quot; or &quot;report generation&quot;), and which agent should handle it.  You can also pass along some initial information, or a &quot;payload,&quot; that the agent will need to get started. The function will then promise to return a result once the pipeline is complete, which will be of type <code>T</code>. Think of it as sending a job request to your agent workforce.</p>
<a id="function-scope" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function scope<a href="#function-scope" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you run a piece of code, like a task or a function, inside a controlled environment that understands the overall system and its rules. Think of it as setting up a little sandbox where your code can operate. You can provide your own versions of certain tools – like agents or ways to generate text – if you want to customize how your code interacts with the larger system. If you don't provide your own tools, it will use the default tools provided by the swarm. It's useful when you need to ensure a function has access to the necessary context and can use the right resources to get its job done.</p>
<a id="function-runstatelessforce" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function runStatelessForce<a href="#function-runstatelessforce" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you send a message to your AI agent swarm and have it processed immediately, without saving the message to the conversation history. It's perfect for things like quickly handling data from external storage or running one-off tasks that don't need to be part of the ongoing dialogue.</p>
<p>Importantly, it will always execute the message, even if the agent currently available isn't the one you expect—it doesn't check agent activity beforehand. You provide the message content and a client ID to identify the request. The system takes care of the rest, tracking performance and notifying relevant systems along the way.</p>
<a id="function-runstateless" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function runStateless<a href="#function-runstateless" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you quickly run a command or instruction through one of your AI agents without adding it to the ongoing conversation history. Think of it as sending a one-off request – useful for things like processing data or performing tasks that don't need to be part of a continuous chat.</p>
<p>It ensures the agent you're using is still available and properly configured. The command is then executed in a fresh environment, and the system keeps track of performance and sends out notifications. If the assigned agent has been replaced during the swarm session, the request is ignored.</p>
<p>You’ll need to provide the content of the command, a client identifier for tracking, and the name of the specific agent you want to use to execute it. The function returns the result of the execution as a string.</p>
<a id="function-questionforce" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function questionForce<a href="#function-questionforce" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function allows you to directly trigger a question-answering process, even if it doesn't naturally arise from a conversation. You provide the actual question you want answered as the <code>message</code>, along with a unique identifier for the client using the service (<code>clientId</code>) and the specific knowledge base or &quot;wiki&quot; where the answer should be sought (<code>wikiName</code>). The function then returns the answer as a string. Think of it as a way to bypass normal chat flow and get a direct answer from your AI agents.</p>
<a id="function-question" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function question<a href="#function-question" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you send a question or message to your AI agent swarm. It’s designed to be used within a conversation, allowing the agents to understand the context. You’ll need to provide the actual message you want the agents to consider, a unique identifier for the client asking the question, the specific agent responsible for handling it, and the relevant knowledge base or “wiki” the agent should use to find an answer. The function then returns a promise that resolves to the agent's response.</p>
<a id="function-overridewiki" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideWiki<a href="#function-overridewiki" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you change the setup of a wiki within the agent swarm. Think of it as updating a wiki’s configuration – you can provide a new or partial schema to modify its properties. It's designed to work independently, making sure the changes are isolated and clean. If your system is set up to log events, this override will be recorded. You just need to provide the new or updated information for the wiki you want to change.</p>
<a id="function-overridetool" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideTool<a href="#function-overridetool" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you change the definition of a tool already registered within the AI agent swarm. Think of it as modifying an existing tool's blueprint – you can add to it or replace parts of it.  It's designed to be a straightforward way to adjust tool configurations without affecting anything else that’s currently running. The system will record that a tool has been altered if logging is turned on. You provide a new or partial definition for the tool, and it updates the swarm's understanding of that tool.</p>
<a id="function-overrideswarm" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideSwarm<a href="#function-overrideswarm" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you directly modify the setup of a swarm within the system. Think of it as a way to quickly adjust how a group of AI agents is organized and operates. You can provide a new or partial configuration, and this function will apply those changes. It’s designed to be a standalone operation, ensuring that any adjustments are isolated and don't interfere with ongoing processes. The system will also record this modification if logging is turned on. You simply provide the new swarm configuration, and the function handles updating the system’s understanding of that swarm.</p>
<a id="function-overridestorage" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideStorage<a href="#function-overridestorage" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you modify how your swarm stores data. Think of it as updating the blueprint for a specific storage location. You can provide a new schema or just parts of one to change its configuration. It's designed to work independently, ensuring a safe and isolated update process. If your system is set up to record actions, this override will be logged.</p>
<p>The function accepts a schema as input, which outlines the details of the storage you're changing.</p>
<a id="function-overridestate" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideState<a href="#function-overridestate" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you change the way the swarm system manages its state. Think of it as a way to refine or adjust the blueprint for a specific state, potentially adding new details or modifying existing ones. It's designed to be a direct update, working independently of any ongoing tasks, making sure the changes are isolated and predictable.  If the system is set up to log activity, you'll see a record of this state override happening. You provide a new or partial state definition, and the system applies those changes to the existing state configuration.</p>
<a id="function-overridepolicy" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overridePolicy<a href="#function-overridepolicy" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you change how a policy works within the swarm. You can provide a new or updated version of the policy’s rules and settings, essentially tweaking its behavior. It’s designed to make these changes safely, keeping them separate from any ongoing tasks. The system will record these policy adjustments if logging is turned on. You only need to provide the parts of the policy you want to change – you don't have to redefine the whole thing.</p>
<a id="function-overridepipeline" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overridePipeline<a href="#function-overridepipeline" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you modify an existing pipeline definition. Think of it as a way to tweak a pipeline—maybe you want to change a step, add a new one, or adjust how data flows. You provide a new, partial definition, and it merges with the original, giving you a customized pipeline schema. It's useful when you need to adapt a standard pipeline for a specific use case without starting from scratch. The function returns the updated pipeline schema, ready to be used.</p>
<a id="function-overrideoutline" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideOutline<a href="#function-overrideoutline" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you update an outline schema within the system.

Think of it as updating or adding to a blueprint for how AI agents share information. You provide the original schema as a starting point, and the function returns a new, modified schema that incorporates your changes. It's useful when you need to adjust the structure of the data exchanged between agents.</p>
<a id="function-overrideembeding" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideEmbeding<a href="#function-overrideembeding" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you change how your AI agents understand and process information by adjusting the embedding schema. Think of embeddings as numerical representations of text – this function allows you to fine-tune those representations. You can provide a new or partial schema to update the existing configuration, essentially customizing how the agents interpret data. The change happens independently, ensuring a clean and isolated process, and the system will log this override if logging is active. You can provide only the parts of the schema you need to modify, rather than providing the entire schema again.</p>
<a id="function-overridecompute" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideCompute<a href="#function-overridecompute" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you modify existing compute schemas, which define how AI agents perform tasks.

Think of it as a way to broadcast information to the agents involved.</p>
<p>It’s specifically intended for sessions created using the &quot;makeConnection&quot; setup.</p>
<p>Before sending the message, the system checks to make sure the session, the swarm, and the intended agent are all still working. It even works if an agent has been replaced during the session. The process creates a fresh environment and logs the activity if logging is enabled. Using it with any other session type will result in an error.</p>
<p>You provide the message content and a unique ID for the client sending the notification.</p>
<a id="function-notify" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function notify<a href="#function-notify" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you send a notification message directly out of your AI agent swarm session, like a simple announcement. It’s specifically for sessions created using the &quot;makeConnection&quot; setup.</p>
<p>Think of it as a way to communicate something without triggering any of the usual message processing.</p>
<p>Before sending the message, the system checks to make sure the session and the specified agent are still valid and active. It also sets up a clean environment for the communication and keeps a log of the operation, ensuring everything runs smoothly. Using this function with other session types isn't allowed.</p>
<p>You provide the message content, a unique client ID, and the name of the agent who should be sending the notification.</p>
<a id="function-markonline" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function markOnline<a href="#function-markonline" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you tell the system that a particular client is now active and participating in a specific swarm. Think of it as confirming that a worker is ready to receive tasks. You’re essentially updating the system’s view of which clients are available within a designated group. To use it, you need to provide the unique ID of the client and the name of the swarm they belong to. This helps the orchestration framework know who's ready to contribute.</p>
<a id="function-markoffline" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function markOffline<a href="#function-markoffline" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you tell the system that a particular client is no longer active within a specific swarm. Think of it as updating the system’s view of which agents are currently participating.

You provide the client's unique ID and the name of the swarm it's part of to use this function.</p>
<a id="function-listeneventonce" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function listenEventOnce<a href="#function-listeneventonce" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you set up a temporary listener for events happening within your AI agent swarm. It listens for a specific type of event, identified by a topic name and a client ID, and only triggers once when the event matches your defined filter. You provide a filter function to determine which events should be passed to your callback, and your callback receives the event's data. To prevent unwanted side effects, the callback is processed in a controlled environment, and the listener automatically cleans itself up after that single event – you're given a way to manually stop the listener early if needed. It prevents use of reserved event names.</p>
<a id="function-listenevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function listenEvent<a href="#function-listenevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you tune in to specific messages being sent around your AI agent swarm. You tell it which client or all clients you want to listen to, and which topic – or message type – you're interested in. Whenever a message matching those criteria arrives, a function you provide will be automatically run, giving you access to the message's contents. Importantly, it gives you a way to later stop listening to those messages, ensuring you can clean up your listeners when they're no longer needed. There are certain message types you can't listen to, to keep things organized and prevent conflicts.</p>
<a id="function-json" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function json<a href="#function-json" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you request and receive data formatted as JSON, following a predefined structure. Think of it as a way to ask for information and get it back in a predictable, machine-readable format. You specify which data structure you want using an &quot;outline name,&quot; and you can also provide input parameters to customize the result. The function handles the behind-the-scenes work of making sure the process is clean and isolated. Essentially, it's your go-to method for consistently retrieving structured data.</p>
<a id="function-hassession" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function hasSession<a href="#function-hassession" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function quickly tells you whether an active session exists for a specific client. It's used to verify if a client is currently connected and authorized. Behind the scenes, it checks with the session management system to confirm the session's validity.

<p>You can think of it as a post office for software components.  It allows parts of the system to send messages (events) and other parts to receive them. This is particularly useful for things like monitoring execution progress, tracking performance, or reacting to changes in the system.</p>
<p>It’s designed to be efficient, remembering previously created subscriptions to avoid unnecessary work. The system also supports &quot;wildcard&quot; subscriptions where a service can listen for events that apply to the entire system, rather than just a specific client.</p>
<p>To help with managing the flow of information, it works closely with other services: <code>LoggerService</code> helps with logging what's happening, <code>SessionValidationService</code> makes sure only authorized clients are sending messages, and <code>PerfService</code> uses the message flow for performance tracking. It also provides special methods, <code>commitExecutionBegin</code> and <code>commitExecutionEnd</code>, as shortcuts for sending execution-related events. Finally, there’s a <code>dispose</code> function to clean up all the subscriptions when a client is finished, ensuring everything is properly released.</p>

Think of it as a way to manage the flow and timing of your agents’ work. The <code>delay</code> property lets you specify a waiting period between sessions, essentially pacing the agents' activities. You can also use <code>onDispose</code> to define a function that runs when the session ends, allowing you to clean up resources or log completion.</p>
<a id="interface-isession" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface ISession<a href="#interface-isession" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>ISession</code> interface defines how you interact with a conversation or workflow within the agent swarm. It provides tools for sending messages, running commands, and managing the session's state.</p>
<p>You can use <code>commitUserMessage</code> and <code>commitAssistantMessage</code> to add messages to the conversation's history without triggering any further actions. <code>commitSystemMessage</code> and <code>commitDeveloperMessage</code> let you add internal messages that might be useful for debugging or controlling the session.</p>
<p>To clear the entire conversation history and reset the agents, use <code>commitFlush</code>. If you need to temporarily halt the next step in an automated process, <code>commitStopTools</code> can pause further agent calls.</p>
<p>The <code>emit</code> function sends a message through the session’s communication channel. <code>notify</code> is similar but is used for internal communication with listeners.</p>
<p>For quick, isolated tasks or previews without affecting the main conversation, the <code>run</code> function allows you to execute stateless completions.  <code>execute</code> is your primary method for running commands within the session, potentially updating the chat history depending on the chosen mode.</p>
<p><code>connect</code> establishes a two-way communication channel, allowing messages to flow in both directions. When agents use tools, <code>commitToolOutput</code> records their results, and <code>commitToolRequest</code> handles requests for tools.</p>

Think of it as a blueprint for how a specific workflow should run.</p>
<p>Each pipeline needs a descriptive <code>pipelineName</code> to identify it.</p>
<p>The core of the pipeline is the <code>execute</code> function.  This is where the magic happens – it tells the framework how to run the pipeline, identifying the client, agent, and data (<code>payload</code>) involved, and returns a promise that resolves with either void or the data produced by the pipeline.</p>
<p>Finally, <code>callbacks</code> lets you define functions to be triggered at different points in the pipeline’s execution, allowing for flexible handling of events and asynchronous operations. This allows your pipeline to react to intermediate results or perform actions after completion.</p>

The <code>useChatAdapter</code> method is how you tell the system which type of chat system you’re using – essentially, you provide a blueprint for creating that chat interface.</p>
<p>Similarly, <code>useChatCallbacks</code> allows you to customize how the chat system interacts with your agents by setting specific functions that get triggered at different points in the conversation flow. This lets you tailor the experience and control certain behaviors.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatargs" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatArgs<a href="#interface-ichatargs" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface, <code>IChatArgs</code>, defines the information needed to send a message to an agent within the system. Think of it as the standard format for communication with individual agents. Each message requires a unique client identifier (<code>clientId</code>), the name of the agent responsible for the conversation (<code>agentName</code>), and the actual content of the message itself (<code>message</code>). Using this structure ensures that messages are routed correctly and that the system knows who is talking to whom.</p>
<a id="interface-ibuseventcontext" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBusEventContext<a href="#interface-ibuseventcontext" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface provides extra information about where an event originates within the system. Think of it as a way to tag events with details about the agent, swarm, storage, state, compute, or policy involved. Client agents typically only use the <code>agentName</code> to identify themselves, but other parts of the system might use these other fields to provide more context for swarm-wide or system-level events. It’s like adding labels to events so you know exactly what's happening and where. For instance, you could tag an event with the agent's name (&quot;Agent1&quot;), the swarm it belongs to (&quot;SwarmA&quot;), or the storage it's interacting with (&quot;Storage1&quot;).</p>
<a id="interface-ibusevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBusEvent<a href="#interface-ibusevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface describes the structure of messages sent across the system's internal communication channels, particularly by agents. Think of it as the standard format for agents to tell the system what they're doing and what they’re seeing.</p>
<p>Each message has a source, indicating where it's coming from (usually the agent bus). It also has a type, which clearly defines the purpose of the message, like requesting a task to run or sharing an output.  The message also includes input data, representing any information needed for the event, and output data, containing the results. Finally, a context section provides additional information, often including the agent's name, to help the system understand where the message originated.</p>
<a id="interface-ibus" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBus<a href="#interface-ibus" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>IBus</code> interface provides a way for different parts of the system to communicate with each other, especially for notifying clients about what's happening. Think of it as a central messaging system.</p>
<p>Agents use this bus to send updates, like when a task is finished, a message is committed, or a tool produces output. These messages are targeted to specific clients, ensuring the right information reaches the intended recipient.</p>
<p>When an agent sends a message, it includes details like the type of event, where it came from, any input data, results, metadata about the agent, and crucially, the client ID it's targeted to.</p>
<p>The <code>emit</code> method is how you actually send these messages. It’s asynchronous, meaning the message is added to a queue and delivered later. This allows the agent to continue working without waiting for the message to be sent.</p>
<p>The <code>clientId</code> is repeated in the message content as a way to double-check that the message is going to the right place.  It helps keep everything organized and reliable. By using a defined structure and type safety, the bus facilitates consistent communication across the system.</p>

Every event, whether it’s a standard system notification or something custom, will inherit from this base.</p>
<p>Each event will have a <code>source</code>, indicating where it came from (like a specific agent or system component). It also includes a <code>clientId</code> to make sure the event reaches the right client or agent instance within the system. Think of these as labels ensuring events are routed correctly.</p>
<a id="interface-iagenttoolcallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentToolCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagenttoolcallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines a set of optional functions you can use to interact with and monitor an agent tool as it runs. Think of them as event listeners for different stages of the tool’s lifecycle.</p>
<p>You can use <code>onBeforeCall</code> to do things like log the tool being called or prepare data beforehand. <code>onAfterCall</code> lets you clean up after the tool finishes or perform actions based on its result.</p>
<p><code>onValidate</code> gives you a chance to check if the tool's input parameters are correct before the tool even runs, preventing potential errors.  Finally, <code>onCallError</code> helps you handle any errors that occur during the tool’s execution, allowing you to log them or attempt recovery. These callbacks give you fine-grained control and visibility into how your agent tools are operating.</p>
<a id="interface-iagenttool" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentTool<a href="#interface-iagenttool" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines a tool that an AI agent can use, building upon a more general tool interface. Each tool has a name for easy identification within the swarm and an optional description to help users understand how to use it.</p>
<p>You can specify when a tool is available for use, and also implement validation checks to ensure the input parameters are correct before the tool runs.  The framework lets you customize the tool's lifecycle with optional callbacks.</p>
<p>The <code>call</code> method is how the tool is actually executed, taking into account details like the client ID, agent name, tool parameters, and whether this is the final call. The tool type is currently fixed to <code>function</code>.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemainternalcallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaInternalCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagentschemainternalcallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface provides a set of optional hooks you can use to monitor and react to different stages of an agent’s lifecycle. Think of them as notification points—you can plug in your own functions to be called when something specific happens, like when an agent starts running, produces output, or encounters an error.</p>
<p>You can listen for events such as when the agent is initialized, when tools are requested or when the agent's history needs to be cleared. There are also callbacks for developer messages, assistant messages and user messages, allowing you to track the flow of communication. Error handling is supported with a callback that fires when a tool experiences a problem. Finally, you can monitor when an agent is brought back online after a pause or failure.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemainternal" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaInternal<a href="#interface-iagentschemainternal" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how an agent is configured within the swarm. It outlines all the settings that shape the agent's behavior, from its primary instructions to the tools it can use and how it interacts with other agents.</p>
<p>You can give the agent a descriptive name and a helpful description for documentation purposes. The <code>prompt</code> setting is crucial, as it provides the core instructions for the agent, while the optional <code>system</code> prompts can define tool-calling protocols.</p>
<p>You can limit the number of tool calls and the size of the conversation history, and specify which tools, storage, wikis, and states the agent can access.  You can also define dependencies on other agents and create custom validation and transformation functions for the agent’s output.</p>
<p>Finally, you can hook into various lifecycle events using callbacks to tailor the agent’s execution flow. If the agent is an operator, special functions handle connection to the operator dashboard.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemacallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagentschemacallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you hook into different stages of an agent's lifecycle, allowing you to monitor and potentially influence its behavior. You can define functions to be called when an agent starts running, when it produces output, when it requests a tool, or when it encounters a system message. These callbacks provide visibility into the agent's internal processes and allow for customization or logging of key events like tool usage, message generation, and state resets. You can also be notified when an agent is initialized, disposed, or resurrected after a pause, offering full control over the agent's operational flow.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschema" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchema<a href="#interface-iagentschema" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface, <code>IAgentSchema</code>, defines the structure for describing an AI agent within the orchestration framework. It allows you to specify instructions or guidelines for each agent, ensuring they operate consistently and effectively.</p>
<p>You can provide static system prompts using the <code>system</code> property, which can be a single prompt or an array of prompts.  <code>systemStatic</code> is simply an alternative name for the <code>system</code> property.</p>
<p>For more flexibility, the <code>systemDynamic</code> property allows you to generate system prompts on the fly. This property accepts a function that can use information like a client ID and agent name to create customized prompts, allowing for dynamic and context-aware agent instructions.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentparams" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentParams<a href="#interface-iagentparams" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the information passed to each agent when it runs. Think of it as the agent's configuration.</p>
<p>It includes essential components like a client ID to identify who's interacting, a logger to record what the agent is doing, a communication bus to talk to other agents in the swarm, and a mechanism to use external tools. There's also a history tracker to remember past interactions and a way to generate final responses.</p>
<p>Agents can be given a list of tools they can use, and there’s a validation step to ensure the output is correct before it's sent back.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentnavigationparams" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentNavigationParams<a href="#interface-iagentnavigationparams" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how you can tell the system to create navigation tools for your AI agents. Think of it as a way to set up a specific action an agent can take – like moving to a different agent or location. You'll specify the tool's name, what it does, where it needs to go, and optionally add some extra documentation to explain its purpose. It’s all about defining the pathway for your agents to interact with each other and their environment.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentconnectionservice" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentConnectionService<a href="#interface-iagentconnectionservice" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface helps define how different agents connect and communicate within the swarm. Think of it as a blueprint for building reliable connections – it lays out the structure for managing those links while keeping internal workings separate from what's exposed publicly. It’s designed to make sure the public-facing parts of the agent connection service are consistent and well-defined.</p>
<a id="interface-iagent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgent<a href="#interface-iagent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>IAgent</code> interface defines how you interact with an agent within the orchestration framework. It lets you run the agent to test things out without affecting its memory, or execute it fully to have it process inputs and potentially update its history.  You can also wait for the agent to finish its work and retrieve the result.</p>
<p>Beyond running the agent, you have methods to manage its internal workings. These methods allow you to add messages to its history – whether they are tool outputs, system instructions, messages from developers, user inputs, assistant responses, or tool requests.  You can even flush the entire history to reset the agent, prevent further tool usage, or cancel ongoing output generation. Effectively, this interface gives you fine-grained control over the agent's lifecycle and the information it processes.</p>
