<p><strong>Overall Architecture:</strong></p>
<p>This system built around a distributed, asynchronous architecture. Agents communicate via a message queue, and their interactions are orchestrated through a series of tools and processes. The core concept is to allow agents to perform tasks independently while still being part of a larger, coordinated system.</p>
<p><strong>Core Concepts &amp; Relationships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swarm Orchestration:</strong> The entire framework is built around orchestrating agents to perform tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Agent as the Central Unit:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> is the fundamental building block – the individual agent that executes tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Communication (Bus):</strong> The <code>IAgentParams</code> interface highlights the importance of the <code>bus</code> (a messaging system) for agents to communicate and coordinate.</li>
<li><strong>History Management:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> and <code>IAgentParams</code> emphasize the agent's ability to operate without relying on conversation history (using the <code>run</code> method).</li>
<li><strong>Tool Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>call</code> and <code>execute</code> methods are central to running tools within the agent.</li>
<li><strong>Schema &amp; Configuration:</strong> The <code>IAgentSchema</code> defines the configuration for each agent, including its tools, prompt, and completion mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interface Breakdown &amp; Key Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a summary of each interface and its role:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>IAgent</code>:</strong> The core runtime agent.  Handles independent execution, tool calls, message commitment, and lifecycle management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentParams</code>:</strong>  Provides the agent with the necessary parameters for operation, including its ID, logging, communication channel, and history management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchema</code>:</strong> Defines the configuration settings for an agent (tools, prompt, completion mechanism).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchemaCallbacks</code>:</strong>  Provides callbacks for managing different stages of an agent’s lifecycle (init, run, output, etc.).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentConnectionService</code>:</strong> A type definition for an <code>AgentConnectionService</code> – a service that manages connections between the agents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Workflow Implications</strong></p>
<p>Based on these interfaces, here’s a workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Agent Configuration:</strong> An <code>IAgentSchema</code> is created to define the agent’s settings.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Instantiation:</strong> An <code>IAgent</code> instance is created based on the schema.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>execute</code> method is called to initiate independent operation.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Calls:</strong>  The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>call</code> to execute tools.</li>
<li><strong>Message Handling:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>commitToolOutput</code>, <code>commitSystemMessage</code>, and <code>commitUserMessage</code> to manage messages.</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses the <code>bus</code> (via <code>IAgentParams</code>) to communicate with other agents.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key Concepts &amp; Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> Agents maintain their own state (conversation history, tool outputs, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Decoupling:</strong> The interfaces are designed to decouple different components of the system. This allows for flexibility and easier maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Event-Driven Architecture:</strong> The use of callbacks suggests an event-driven architecture, where components communicate through events rather than direct calls.</li>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> The interfaces highlight the importance of managing the agent's state, including conversation history, tool output, and system messages.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Integration:</strong> The <code>tools</code> property in <code>IAgentParams</code> indicates a system designed to integrate with external tools.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous Communication:</strong> Agents communicate asynchronously via a bus, allowing them to operate independently.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The system is designed to be flexible, a</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Use Cases:</strong></p>
<p>This architecture could be used for a wide range of applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chatbots:</strong>  Agents could be used to power conversational AI systems.</li>
<li><strong>Content Generation:</strong> Agents could be used to generate text, images, or other content.</li>
<li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Agents could be used to analyze data and generate insights.</li>

Each instance is tied to a specific client ID and lets you define custom callbacks to handle different events.</p>
<p>It initializes itself when needed, loading any previously saved data. You can loop through the messages in the history, applying any filtering rules or system prompts you've set up.  When a new message arrives, it's added to the history and saved for later, and you can configure how those additions are handled.  Similarly, you can remove messages from the end of the history, with custom actions triggered by that removal. Finally, you can completely clear the history, either for a specific agent or for all agents.</p>

It keeps track of all the valid completion names, making sure no two are the same and preventing incorrect names from being used.</p>
<p>It works closely with other parts of the system – ensuring completion names are properly registered, validating agent actions, and logging everything that happens. To speed things up, it remembers the results of previous validation checks.</p>
<p>You can add new completion names to this service to keep the list of valid names up-to-date. When an agent tries to use a completion name, this service checks to make sure it’s a registered name, and logs the result of the check.</p>
<a id="class-completionschemaservice" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class CompletionSchemaService<a href="#class-completionschemaservice" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The CompletionSchemaService acts as a central hub for managing the logic (completion functions) that agents use to perform tasks. It's like a library where agents can find the instructions they need.</p>
<p>This service keeps track of these instructions, ensuring they are valid and available to different parts of the system, such as when agents are created or when they’s running. It checks that the instructions are properly formatted before they're added to the library, and it allows you to update existing instructions.</p>
<p>The service logs its activities for monitoring purposes, and it’s designed to work closely with other core services in the swarm system, making sure agents can reliably execute their tasks using the correct logic. It uses a registry to store and quickly retrieve these instructions.</p>

It keeps track of which agent is currently active, manages how the agents switch between tasks, and handles the flow of information between them.</p>
<p>Think of it as a central hub:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agent Management:</strong> It remembers which agents are available and manages when they are &quot;active.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Navigation:</strong> It has a &quot;navigation stack&quot; – a record of how you're moving between agents to complete a task.</li>
<li><strong>Output Handling:</strong> It waits for results from agents and delivers those results to whoever needs them. It also allows you to quickly cancel a pending result if needed.</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong>  It sends out notifications whenever something changes—like when an agent is switched or a result is ready.</li>
</ul>
<p>The class also integrates with other parts of the system like how the swarm is initially set up, how individual agents are executed, and how events are tracked and handled. When you're finished with the swarm, you can cleanly shut it down to release resources.</p>

Think of it as a central repository for information that agents can access and compare.</p>
<p>It provides ways to add, remove, and clear data, and importantly, it can find data similar to a given search term. The operations are handled in a controlled order, ensuring everything happens smoothly and safely, even when multiple parts of the system are trying to interact with the storage at the same time.</p>
<p>When new data is added or existing data is modified, the system automatically calculates and stores “embeddings” – mathematical representations of the data's meaning – so that similar data can be easily found. It also keeps track of when the storage is fully initialized and provides ways to clean up when the storage is no longer needed.</p>
<a id="class-clientsession" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class ClientSession<a href="#class-clientsession" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>ClientSession</code> is like a dedicated workspace for a client interacting with an AI agent swarm. It manages all the messages, actions, and interactions happening within that specific session.</p>
<p>Think of it as a central hub that handles sending messages, validating them against pre-defined rules (ClientPolicy), and making sure the right AI agents are involved.  It also keeps track of what's happening, logging events and potentially sending notifications to other parts of the system.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of what you can do with it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Send Messages:</strong> You can send messages to the swarm for processing (using <code>execute</code> or <code>run</code>). <code>execute</code> follows the rules and policy checks, while <code>run</code> is more for quick, stateless tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Log Actions:</strong>  It lets you record user inputs, assistant responses, and system-level actions within the session’s history.</li>
<li><strong>Control the Agent:</strong> You can tell the agent to stop its current process (<code>commitStopTools</code>) or clear its memory (<code>commitFlush</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Connect and Interact:</strong>  It allows real-time communication between the client and the swarm, allowing messages to be sent and received.</li>
<li><strong>Clean Up:</strong> When the session is finished, it can safely shut down, releasing any resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, <code>ClientSession</code> provides a structured and controlled environment for interacting with the AI agent swarm, ensuring consistency and traceability.</p>

It keeps track of banned clients, performs checks on messages going in and out, and can automatically ban clients that violate the defined policies.</p>
<p>Think of it as a gatekeeper – it verifies client identity, examines messages to make sure they're acceptable, and enforces restrictions set at the swarm level.  It can be configured to automatically ban clients if they fail validation and it provides customizable messages to explain why a client was banned.  The ban list itself isn’t loaded immediately, only when needed, making it efficient.</p>
<p>It works closely with other parts of the system like the ClientAgent (for message filtering) and the BusService (for announcing policy-related events).  The system allows for dynamically adding or removing clients from the ban list, which can be persistently stored if needed.</p>

It provides methods for sending instructions, retrieving results, and coordinating the agents’ actions.</p>
<p>Think of it as a central hub. You use <code>commitUserMessage</code> to give the agents tasks, and <code>waitForOutput</code> to patiently await their responses.</p>
<p>Currently, some features like committing tool outputs, system messages, assistant messages, or flushing are not functional, serving as placeholders for future expansion.  The <code>commitAgentChange</code> method allows you to signal changes within the agent system, and <code>dispose</code> cleans up resources when you’re finished.  The <code>execute</code> method is available for running input with specified mode.</p>
<a id="class-clientmcp" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class ClientMCP<a href="#class-clientmcp" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This component, the ClientMCP, acts as a bridge between your application and the system's available tools. It manages tools for specific clients, keeping track of which tools are available and caching them to improve performance.</p>
<p>You can use it to see a list of tools a client has access to, verify if a tool exists for a client, or even call a tool with the necessary data.  When the tools need to be refreshed – perhaps because new ones have been added or updated – you can trigger a refresh for a single client or for all clients.</p>
<p>Finally, when a client is no longer needed, you can clean up resources and release cached tools using the dispose function.</p>

Think of it as a controller for a specific processing unit.</p>
<p>It's initialized with configuration parameters that define its behavior and connection details. It holds internal functions for managing its lifecycle and retrieving data.</p>
<p>The <code>calculate</code> method initiates a processing cycle, driven by a specific state. The <code>update</code> method allows refreshing the compute resource’s status. The <code>getComputeData</code> method retrieves information about the compute resource. Finally, <code>dispose</code> gracefully shuts down and releases any resources held by this compute instance.</p>

It's responsible for executing instructions, managing tool usage, and keeping track of the conversation history. Think of it as the &quot;brain&quot; of an agent.</p>
<p>It's built with asynchronous operations in mind, preventing overlap and using subjects to manage various states like tool errors or agent changes. It connects to several other services for handling history, tools, completions, and coordination with other agents.</p>
<p><strong>Key features and how they work:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Execution:</strong> It receives instructions (<code>execute</code>, <code>run</code>) and processes them, calling tools if needed. It prioritizes preventing multiple tasks from running at once.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Management:</strong>  <code>_resolveTools</code> finds and organizes the tools the agent can use, making sure there are no duplicates. <code>commitToolOutput</code> records the results of using those tools.</li>
<li><strong>System Prompting:</strong>  <code>_resolveSystemPrompt</code> puts together the initial context for the agent, combining static and dynamic instructions.</li>
<li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> If something goes wrong, <code>_resurrectModel</code> tries to recover, potentially retrying the task or providing a placeholder result.</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong>  It broadcasts outputs and events to other parts of the system and potentially to other agents in the swarm.</li>
<li><strong>Lifecycle:</strong> <code>dispose</code> performs cleanup when the agent is no longer needed.</li>

Think of it as a central hub that creates, sends messages to, and cleans up after these chat interactions.</p>
<p>The <code>getChatInstance</code> method is key—it either provides an existing chat session for a client or sets one up if it doesn't exist.  <code>beginChat</code> formally starts a new session, and <code>sendMessage</code> is how you actually transmit messages through that session.  If you need to be notified when a chat session is ending, <code>listenDispose</code> allows you to register a function that gets called when that happens. Finally, <code>dispose</code> is used to cleanly shut down a chat session.</p>
<p>You can customize how chat instances are created and how they behave by using <code>useChatAdapter</code> to specify a constructor and <code>useChatCallbacks</code> to provide custom event handlers.</p>
<a id="class-chatinstance" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class ChatInstance<a href="#class-chatinstance" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>ChatInstance</code> class manages a single chat session within an AI agent swarm. It’s given a unique client identifier and a name for the swarm it belongs to. It also uses a function to handle cleanup when the chat is finished and optionally, receives callback functions for various chat events.</p>
<p>Internally, it tracks when the chat was last active, and keeps track of the chat session itself. The <code>checkLastActivity</code> method verifies if the chat is still considered active based on a timeout.  You can start a chat session using <code>beginChat</code>, and send messages with <code>sendMessage</code>. When you're done, <code>dispose</code> cleans everything up. Finally, <code>listenDispose</code> lets you register a function to be notified when the chat instance is disposed.</p>
<a id="class-busservice" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class BusService<a href="#class-busservice" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This class, <code>BusService</code>, is the central hub for event-driven communication within the agent swarm. Think of it as the mailman, responsible for delivering messages (events) between different parts of the system. It manages subscriptions, making sure the right recipients get the events they're interested in.</p>
<p>You can subscribe to specific event types from a client, or even subscribe generally to catch all events of a certain type.  When an event occurs, <code>BusService</code> delivers it to all the interested subscribers.  It also handles special events like the start and end of execution tasks.</p>
<p>Crucially, it ensures only valid client sessions can receive events, and it keeps track of all subscriptions to allow for cleanup when a client disconnects. It's designed to be efficient, reusing connection resources whenever possible. The system can also send broad system-wide notifications to those subscribing with wildcards. Think of it as the nervous system for your AI agents.</p>

Think of it as the basic unit of communication – whether it’s a user’s prompt, a tool’s output, or a system notification. It's used to track what’s happened in a conversation, generate responses, and pass information around.</p>
<p>Each message has a <code>role</code> to indicate who or what sent it: <code>tool</code>, <code>user</code>, <code>assistant</code> (the AI model), <code>system</code> (for system-level messages), <code>resque</code> (related to error recovery), or <code>flush</code> (for resetting history).  A <code>agentName</code> identifies which agent sent the message. The <code>content</code> is the actual text or data being communicated.</p>
<p>The <code>mode</code> tells you whether the message came from a <code>user</code> or a <code>tool</code>, influencing how it’s processed.  <code>tool_calls</code> are included when the model requests a tool to be executed.  If a tool responds, the <code>tool_call_id</code> links that response back to the original tool request. Finally, a <code>payload</code> allows for attaching extra data to the message.</p>

Think of it as a way to tag events with details about which agent, swarm, or other system components are involved.</p>
<p>Typically, when an agent is sending an event, only the <code>agentName</code> is filled in, which simply identifies the agent sending the message. However, other fields like <code>swarmName</code>, <code>storageName</code>, <code>stateName</code>, <code>computeName</code>, and <code>policyName</code> become useful for system-wide events or when tracking activity at a higher level, such as within a particular swarm or related to a specific policy. Each of these fields provides a unique identifier for a component participating in the event, helping to provide a richer understanding of what’s happening.</p>
<a id="interface-ibusevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBusEvent<a href="#interface-ibusevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the structure of messages sent through the system's internal communication bus. Think of it as a standardized way for different parts of the system, especially the agents, to talk to each other and share information.</p>
<p>Each message has a clear origin, identified by its <code>source</code>.  It also has a <code>type</code> which tells other components what the message is about—like notifying the system a task is starting or sharing a tool’s output.</p>
<p>Along with the core information, messages can carry <code>input</code> data needed to perform an action or <code>output</code> data representing the result of an action.  Finally, a <code>context</code> section provides extra information, like the agent that sent the message. This helps keep track of who did what and allows for more informed responses across the system.</p>
<a id="interface-ibus" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBus<a href="#interface-ibus" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>IBus</code> interface provides a way for different parts of the system, especially agents, to send updates and information to specific clients. Think of it as a central messaging system.</p>
<p>Agents use the <code>emit</code> method to broadcast events like message commits, tool executions, or completed runs to a designated client.  Each event follows a standard format, including details about its origin, data, and intended recipient. This ensures everyone on the system receives the information they need in a consistent way.</p>
<p>The <code>emit</code> method always targets a specific client ID, making sure the information reaches the right place.  It’s primarily used for notifications—for example, informing clients about changes or the results of actions—and the process is asynchronous, meaning events are handled efficiently behind the scenes. The <code>clientId</code> field is repeated in the event itself, which can be helpful for confirming the message was intended for the correct client. Events must adhere to a defined structure, ensuring consistency and allowing for easier processing.</p>
