<p><strong>Overall Architecture:</strong></p>
<p>This system built around a distributed, asynchronous architecture. Agents communicate via a message queue, and their interactions are orchestrated through a series of tools and processes. The core concept is to allow agents to perform tasks independently while still being part of a larger, coordinated system.</p>
<p><strong>Core Concepts &amp; Relationships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swarm Orchestration:</strong> The entire framework is built around orchestrating agents to perform tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Agent as the Central Unit:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> is the fundamental building block – the individual agent that executes tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Communication (Bus):</strong> The <code>IAgentParams</code> interface highlights the importance of the <code>bus</code> (a messaging system) for agents to communicate and coordinate.</li>
<li><strong>History Management:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> and <code>IAgentParams</code> emphasize the agent's ability to operate without relying on conversation history (using the <code>run</code> method).</li>
<li><strong>Tool Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>call</code> and <code>execute</code> methods are central to running tools within the agent.</li>
<li><strong>Schema &amp; Configuration:</strong> The <code>IAgentSchema</code> defines the configuration for each agent, including its tools, prompt, and completion mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interface Breakdown &amp; Key Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a summary of each interface and its role:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>IAgent</code>:</strong> The core runtime agent.  Handles independent execution, tool calls, message commitment, and lifecycle management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentParams</code>:</strong>  Provides the agent with the necessary parameters for operation, including its ID, logging, communication channel, and history management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchema</code>:</strong> Defines the configuration settings for an agent (tools, prompt, completion mechanism).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchemaCallbacks</code>:</strong>  Provides callbacks for managing different stages of an agent’s lifecycle (init, run, output, etc.).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentConnectionService</code>:</strong> A type definition for an <code>AgentConnectionService</code> – a service that manages connections between the agents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Workflow Implications</strong></p>
<p>Based on these interfaces, here’s a workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Agent Configuration:</strong> An <code>IAgentSchema</code> is created to define the agent’s settings.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Instantiation:</strong> An <code>IAgent</code> instance is created based on the schema.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>execute</code> method is called to initiate independent operation.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Calls:</strong>  The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>call</code> to execute tools.</li>
<li><strong>Message Handling:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>commitToolOutput</code>, <code>commitSystemMessage</code>, and <code>commitUserMessage</code> to manage messages.</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses the <code>bus</code> (via <code>IAgentParams</code>) to communicate with other agents.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key Concepts &amp; Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> Agents maintain their own state (conversation history, tool outputs, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Decoupling:</strong> The interfaces are designed to decouple different components of the system. This allows for flexibility and easier maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Event-Driven Architecture:</strong> The use of callbacks suggests an event-driven architecture, where components communicate through events rather than direct calls.</li>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> The interfaces highlight the importance of managing the agent's state, including conversation history, tool output, and system messages.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Integration:</strong> The <code>tools</code> property in <code>IAgentParams</code> indicates a system designed to integrate with external tools.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous Communication:</strong> Agents communicate asynchronously via a bus, allowing them to operate independently.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The system is designed to be flexible, a</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Use Cases:</strong></p>
<p>This architecture could be used for a wide range of applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chatbots:</strong>  Agents could be used to power conversational AI systems.</li>
<li><strong>Content Generation:</strong> Agents could be used to generate text, images, or other content.</li>
<li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Agents could be used to analyze data and generate insights.</li>

Think of it as a health check for your AI system – it ensures everything is in a good state. Running this function won't cause any problems, even if you run it multiple times, because it's designed to only validate once during each process.</p>
<a id="function-startpipeline" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function startPipeline<a href="#function-startpipeline" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you kick off a pre-defined workflow, called a pipeline, within the AI agent system. You specify a unique client ID to identify the request, the name of the pipeline you want to run, and the agent responsible for handling it. You can also pass along some data, the payload, that the pipeline will use during its execution. The function will then promise to return a result based on what the pipeline does.</p>
<a id="function-scope" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function scope<a href="#function-scope" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you run a piece of code – like a task or a mini-program – inside a controlled environment. Think of it as setting up a little sandbox where your code operates. You can customize this sandbox by providing your own versions of key components, such as the agents that perform actions, the tools for generating text, or the pipelines that manage workflows. If you don't provide your own versions, it will use the default settings provided by the overall system. Essentially, it provides a way to execute code while ensuring it interacts with the environment in a predictable and manageable way.</p>
<a id="function-runstatelessforce" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function runStatelessForce<a href="#function-runstatelessforce" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you send a message to your AI agent swarm and get a response, but it's special because it doesn't save that message to the agent's memory. Think of it as a one-off instruction – it won't affect future conversations.</p>
<p>It's designed for situations where you need to process things like data storage outputs or simple tasks without filling up the agent’s chat history. Even if the agent isn't actively working right now, this function will still force the message to be processed.</p>
<p>You provide the message content and a unique identifier for your client session, and the function takes care of the rest, including keeping track of how the message was handled and sending out notifications. The function creates a fresh working environment to ensure accurate and isolated execution.</p>
<a id="function-runstateless" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function runStateless<a href="#function-runstateless" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you quickly send a message to an agent in your swarm without saving it to the ongoing conversation history. Think of it as a way to run a single, isolated task or process a piece of data without affecting the agent's memory of previous interactions.</p>
<p>It's especially useful when dealing with things like processing output from external storage or performing short, one-off jobs where you don't want the interaction to build up the chat history.</p>
<p>The function checks to ensure the agent is active before sending the content and keeps track of the process’s performance. It ensures the agent hasn’t changed during the process and won't execute if it has. You provide the message content, a client identifier, and the name of the agent you want to use.</p>
<a id="function-questionforce" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function questionForce<a href="#function-questionforce" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you directly trigger a question-answering process, bypassing the usual chat flow. You provide the question or message you want answered, a unique identifier for who’s asking, and the specific knowledge base (wiki) you want the answer to come from. It’s useful when you need a guaranteed response from the system, regardless of what's already happening in a conversation. The function will return the answer as a string.</p>
<a id="function-question" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function question<a href="#function-question" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you send a question or message to the AI agent swarm for processing. It's the starting point for a conversational turn.</p>
<p>You'll need to provide the actual question as text, a unique identifier for the client asking the question, the name of the specific agent responsible for handling the request, and the name of the knowledge base (wiki) the agent should consult.</p>
<p>The function will then return a promise that resolves to the agent's response to the question.</p>
<a id="function-overridewiki" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideWiki<a href="#function-overridewiki" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you modify the settings for an existing wiki within the agent swarm. Think of it as updating a wiki's configuration – you can change parts of it or provide a completely new setup. It works independently of other processes, ensuring a reliable update.  If logging is turned on, you'll see a record of the change made. You provide the new or updated settings for the wiki through the <code>wikiSchema</code> parameter.</p>
<a id="function-overridetool" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideTool<a href="#function-overridetool" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you modify how a tool behaves within the AI agent swarm. Think of it as a way to customize a tool’s definition – perhaps to change its description, available inputs, or how it handles data. You can provide a new schema or just update specific parts of an existing one. The system makes sure this change is applied cleanly and separately from any ongoing tasks, and it will record the change if logging is turned on. It's all about giving you the flexibility to adjust your tools as needed.</p>
<a id="function-overrideswarm" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideSwarm<a href="#function-overrideswarm" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you change the blueprint for a swarm of AI agents. Think of it as updating the instructions for how the swarm operates. You can provide a new or partial schema to modify existing swarm configurations. This update happens independently, ensuring a clear and isolated change process, and it will log the action if logging is turned on. Essentially, it's a way to adjust the swarm's behavior on the fly. You only need to provide the parts of the schema you want to change; the rest will remain as they were.</p>
<a id="function-overridestorage" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideStorage<a href="#function-overridestorage" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you modify how the swarm system handles data storage. Think of it as a way to tweak the storage configuration, perhaps adding new fields or changing existing ones. It makes these changes directly, ensuring they're isolated and doesn't interfere with ongoing processes.  You can use it to adjust storage details like how data is structured or organized. The provided schema acts as a blueprint for these modifications, allowing you to specify exactly what needs to be changed.</p>

Think of it as a way to broadcast a notification or status update. It’s specifically designed for sessions created using the &quot;makeConnection&quot; method, ensuring a controlled and predictable flow of information.</p>
<p>Before sending the message, the system checks to make sure the connection is valid, the swarm is running, and the agent you've specified is still active. It’s also carefully managed to keep things clean and prevent errors – if something’s changed, like the agent being replaced, the notification will be skipped.</p>
<p>You’ll need to provide the actual message content, a unique ID for the client sending the message, and the name of the agent you want the notification to appear to come from.</p>
<a id="function-markonline" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function markOnline<a href="#function-markonline" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you tell the system that a particular client is now active and participating in a specific swarm. Think of it as updating the status of an agent – you provide the client's unique identifier and the name of the swarm it belongs to, and the system registers that it's online. It’s a straightforward way to keep track of which agents are currently available for tasks within your swarm. You're essentially signaling the system to acknowledge the client's presence and readiness.</p>
<a id="function-markoffline" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function markOffline<a href="#function-markoffline" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you tell the system that a particular client is no longer active within a specific swarm.

You specify which client you want to hear from (or listen to all clients), the event topic, and a filter to determine which events should trigger your callback. When an event matching your filter arrives, your callback function will be executed with the event's data, and the listener automatically stops after that single event. It’s useful for reacting to a specific event once and then stopping the listener, ensuring clean and controlled interactions within the swarm. The function also provides a way to cancel the listener before it triggers.</p>
<a id="function-listenevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function listenEvent<a href="#function-listenevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you set up a listener for specific events happening within the agent swarm. Think of it as subscribing to a channel to receive updates.</p>
<p>You tell the system which client or all clients you want to hear from, and what event topic you're interested in. When an event matching your criteria occurs, a function you provide will be executed, receiving the data associated with the event.</p>
<p>To stop listening to those events, the function returns a special &quot;unsubscribe&quot; function that you can call. The system also makes sure the event names you’re using aren’t reserved and handles events in a controlled order for reliability.</p>
<a id="function-json" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function json<a href="#function-json" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function helps you turn a defined outline – think of it as a blueprint for data – into structured JSON. You give it the name of the outline you want to use, and optionally provide some input parameters. The function then takes care of generating the JSON data based on that outline’s structure. To keep things tidy and prevent issues, it runs this process in a self-contained environment. Essentially, it’s a tool for transforming structured requests into organized JSON outputs.</p>
<a id="function-hassession" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function hasSession<a href="#function-hassession" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function helps you quickly check if a client has an active session. It's a simple way to confirm a client is logged in or connected before proceeding with other actions. Behind the scenes, it uses a dedicated service to handle the actual session verification process, and it will log its activity if logging is turned on. You just need to provide the unique ID of the client you want to check.</p>
<a id="function-hasnavigation" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function hasNavigation<a href="#function-hasnavigation" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function helps determine if a particular agent is included in the navigation plan for a specific client.

<a id="interface-ichatinstancecallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatInstanceCallbacks<a href="#interface-ichatinstancecallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface provides a way for external systems to receive updates and react to events happening within a chat instance managed by the AI agent swarm orchestration framework. You're notified when an instance is initially set up, when it's shut down, and when a chat session starts.  Additionally, you're informed when a message is sent during a chat. The framework also lets you know about the activity status of each instance, which can be useful for monitoring and resource management.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatinstance" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatInstance<a href="#interface-ichatinstance" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface represents a single chat session within the AI agent swarm. It provides methods to start a chat, send messages to it, and check for activity to keep the session alive. You can also use it to clean up the chat instance when it’s no longer needed and set up notifications when a chat is being closed. Essentially, it’s the primary way to interact with and manage a specific AI agent conversation.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatcontrol" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatControl<a href="#interface-ichatcontrol" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This API lets you configure how your AI agents communicate. You can tell the system which type of chat interface to use by providing a constructor for the chat instance.  Also, you can specify which events or actions the system should notify you about as it’s running – essentially, you get to define how you want to be kept in the loop.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatargs" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatArgs<a href="#interface-ichatargs" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface, <code>IChatArgs</code>, defines the information needed to participate in a chat session within the agent swarm. It’s essentially a structured way to pass chat details around.</p>
<p>Each chat requires a <code>clientId</code>, which is a unique label identifying the client initiating the conversation.  You’ll also need to specify the <code>agentName</code> – that's the name of the agent specifically assigned to handle this particular chat. Finally, the core of the chat itself is represented by the <code>message</code> property, which holds the actual text of what’s being communicated.</p>
<a id="interface-ibuseventcontext" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBusEventContext<a href="#interface-ibuseventcontext" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface provides extra information about events happening within the swarm system. Think of it as a way to add context to an event, letting you know which agent, swarm, or other components are involved.</p>
<p>When an agent is sending an event, it usually just includes its own name (agentName) in this context. However, other parts of the system might use this to include details about swarms, storage, states, compute resources, or policies involved in the event. It's a flexible way to add more detail to what's happening within the swarm.</p>
<a id="interface-ibusevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBusEvent<a href="#interface-ibusevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface describes the structure of messages sent across the internal communication system within the agent swarm. Think of it as a standardized way for different parts of the system, especially agents, to talk to each other and notify the central system about actions and changes.</p>
<p>Each message has a source, which identifies where it came from (usually the agent bus); a type, which explains what kind of action is being communicated (like &quot;run&quot; or &quot;commit-user-message&quot;); and then input and output data – essentially, the information being passed along with the notification. Finally, there’s a context section providing extra details about the message, like which agent sent it. It helps ensure consistent communication and makes it easier to understand what’s happening within the swarm.</p>
<a id="interface-ibus" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBus<a href="#interface-ibus" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>IBus</code> interface provides a way for different parts of the AI agent swarm to communicate with each other, especially to update clients. Think of it as a central messaging system.</p>
<p>Agents use the <code>emit</code> method to send notifications – like when a task is finished, a message is committed, or an output is ready – to specific clients.  These notifications are structured events that include information about what happened, where it came from, and who it's intended for. The <code>clientId</code> within the event confirms the target of the notification, adding a layer of verification.</p>
<p>The <code>emit</code> method is asynchronous, meaning the message is queued for delivery instead of being sent immediately. This helps keep the system responsive and allows for more flexible communication patterns.  By using this bus, different components can work together without needing to know exactly what the others are doing, leading to a more organized and manageable swarm.</p>
<a id="interface-ibaseevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBaseEvent<a href="#interface-ibaseevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lays the groundwork for how different parts of the system communicate with each other through events. Think of it as the basic template all events follow. Every event generated in the system will have a <code>source</code> to indicate where it came from, like a specific agent or component. It also includes a <code>clientId</code> so you can make sure the event reaches the right client or agent instance, ensuring messages are delivered to the intended recipient. This foundation allows for flexible and targeted communication throughout the agent swarm.</p>
<a id="interface-iagenttoolcallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentToolCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagenttoolcallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you plug in custom actions that happen around when a tool is used by an agent. You can define what should occur right before a tool runs, after it finishes, or even validate the inputs to ensure they’re correct. If something goes wrong during tool execution, you can also specify a callback to handle the error. These callbacks provide a way to monitor tool usage, ensure data integrity, and gracefully handle unexpected issues.</p>
<a id="interface-iagenttool" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentTool<a href="#interface-iagenttool" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines what a tool looks like within the agent swarm system. Each tool has a unique name and an optional description to help users understand how to use it.</p>
<p>Before a tool can be used, it needs to be checked for availability, considering the current situation.  There’s also a validation step to make sure the input parameters are correct.</p>
<p>You can even add custom lifecycle hooks to control how the tool operates, and the tool must have a defined type, currently <code>function</code>. Finally, the <code>call</code> method is what actually runs the tool, providing it with all the necessary information about the request.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemainternalcallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaInternalCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagentschemainternalcallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface provides a set of hooks that allow you to monitor and react to different stages of an agent's lifecycle. You can use these callbacks to track what an agent is doing, log important events, or even intervene in the agent's execution.</p>
<p>For example, you can listen for <code>onRun</code> to know when an agent is executed without remembering past interactions, or use <code>onToolOutput</code> to observe the results produced by the tools the agent uses. <code>onExecute</code> signals the beginning of agent execution, while <code>onResurrect</code> lets you know when an agent is restarted.</p>
<p>You’re also able to receive updates on developer messages, assistant messages, user messages, tool requests, tool errors, and when the agent’s memory is cleared (<code>onFlush</code>). Finally, you can observe the agent's initialization, disposal, and completion of tool call sequences with <code>onInit</code>, <code>onDispose</code>, and <code>onAfterToolCalls</code> respectively.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemainternal" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaInternal<a href="#interface-iagentschemainternal" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This describes how an agent is configured within the system. Think of it as a blueprint for each individual agent, outlining its personality, capabilities, and how it interacts with the rest of the swarm.</p>
<p>Each agent has a unique name, and it uses a specific &quot;completion&quot; mechanism – essentially, how it generates responses. If the agent isn’t designated as an “operator,” it <em>must</em> have a prompt to guide its actions.  An &quot;operator&quot; agent is special; it's designed to handle live interactions with customers.</p>
<p>The agent can use tools – these are specific functionalities it can access – and it can also store and retrieve information from various storage systems.  It might also rely on other agents (&quot;dependsOn&quot;) to handle transitions or workflows.</p>
<p>You can customize the agent’s behavior even further. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Filtering tool calls:</strong> You can control which tools the agent actually uses.</li>
<li><strong>Limiting context:</strong>  You can specify how much conversation history the agent remembers.</li>
<li><strong>Adding context:</strong> An optional description helps explain what the agent does.</li>
<li><strong>Validating output:</strong>  You can ensure the agent’s responses are accurate and appropriate.</li>
<li><strong>Transforming responses:</strong> You can modify the agent’s output before it’s presented.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, lifecycle callbacks give you even finer-grained control over how the agent functions throughout its execution.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemacallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagentschemacallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines a set of optional hooks that allow you to monitor and react to different stages of an agent's lifecycle. Think of them as event listeners for your agents – you can plug in functions to be notified when an agent starts, produces output, uses tools, or encounters specific situations like being paused or initialized. Each callback function provides information about the agent, the client interacting with it, and the specific event that occurred, enabling you to build custom logic around agent behavior, logging, or debugging. These callbacks offer a flexible way to extend and customize the agent orchestration framework.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschema" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchema<a href="#interface-iagentschema" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the structure for describing an AI agent within the orchestration framework. It focuses on how the agent should behave, primarily through system prompts.</p>
<p>You can provide a static set of instructions for the agent using the <code>system</code> or <code>systemStatic</code> properties; these are essentially the agent's core guidelines.</p>
<p>For more flexibility, <code>systemDynamic</code> lets you generate system prompts on the fly, customizing them based on factors like the client or the agent's name. This allows for really tailored and reactive agent behavior.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentparams" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentParams<a href="#interface-iagentparams" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the settings an agent needs when it’s running. It brings together configuration details, like a unique client identifier, logging utilities, and ways to communicate with the rest of the system.</p>
<p>Think of it as the agent’s toolbox – it includes things like a logger to record what’s happening, a bus for messaging, and a way to access external tools. The interface also lets you provide validation steps to check the agent’s output before it's considered complete, and define a list of tools it can use.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentnavigationparams" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentNavigationParams<a href="#interface-iagentnavigationparams" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the settings needed to guide an AI agent to use a specific tool. It lets you specify the name of the tool you want the agent to use, along with a brief explanation of what the tool does. You also tell the system which agent the navigation should target. Finally, there's a space for adding extra notes about the tool, which is helpful for understanding its purpose or limitations.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentconnectionservice" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentConnectionService<a href="#interface-iagentconnectionservice" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface helps ensure that the publicly available parts of your agent connection service are clearly defined and consistent. Think of it as a blueprint for how others should interact with your agent connection functionality – it focuses on what's important for external use and excludes any internal implementation details. It’s used to create a specific, type-safe version of your connection service designed for public consumption, keeping things organized and predictable.</p>
<a id="interface-iagent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgent<a href="#interface-iagent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>IAgent</code> interface defines how an individual agent operates within the orchestration framework. It outlines the methods available to interact with and control the agent’s behavior.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>run</code> method to test an agent's capabilities with a given input without affecting its history.  The <code>execute</code> method handles the agent’s core processing, potentially modifying its history depending on the chosen mode.  <code>waitForOutput</code> lets you retrieve the agent’s final output after it's finished executing.</p>
<p>Several <code>commit...</code> methods allow you to manage the agent’s internal state. These let you add messages (system, developer, user, assistant) to the agent’s history, log tool requests, and clear the entire history to reset the agent to its starting point.  There are also methods to stop tool executions and signal changes in the agent's operation.</p>
