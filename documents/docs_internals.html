<p><strong>Overall Architecture:</strong></p>
<p>This system built around a distributed, asynchronous architecture. Agents communicate via a message queue, and their interactions are orchestrated through a series of tools and processes. The core concept is to allow agents to perform tasks independently while still being part of a larger, coordinated system.</p>
<p><strong>Core Concepts &amp; Relationships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swarm Orchestration:</strong> The entire framework is built around orchestrating agents to perform tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Agent as the Central Unit:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> is the fundamental building block – the individual agent that executes tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Communication (Bus):</strong> The <code>IAgentParams</code> interface highlights the importance of the <code>bus</code> (a messaging system) for agents to communicate and coordinate.</li>
<li><strong>History Management:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> and <code>IAgentParams</code> emphasize the agent's ability to operate without relying on conversation history (using the <code>run</code> method).</li>
<li><strong>Tool Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>call</code> and <code>execute</code> methods are central to running tools within the agent.</li>
<li><strong>Schema &amp; Configuration:</strong> The <code>IAgentSchema</code> defines the configuration for each agent, including its tools, prompt, and completion mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interface Breakdown &amp; Key Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a summary of each interface and its role:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>IAgent</code>:</strong> The core runtime agent.  Handles independent execution, tool calls, message commitment, and lifecycle management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentParams</code>:</strong>  Provides the agent with the necessary parameters for operation, including its ID, logging, communication channel, and history management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchema</code>:</strong> Defines the configuration settings for an agent (tools, prompt, completion mechanism).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchemaCallbacks</code>:</strong>  Provides callbacks for managing different stages of an agent’s lifecycle (init, run, output, etc.).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentConnectionService</code>:</strong> A type definition for an <code>AgentConnectionService</code> – a service that manages connections between the agents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Workflow Implications</strong></p>
<p>Based on these interfaces, here’s a workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Agent Configuration:</strong> An <code>IAgentSchema</code> is created to define the agent’s settings.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Instantiation:</strong> An <code>IAgent</code> instance is created based on the schema.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>execute</code> method is called to initiate independent operation.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Calls:</strong>  The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>call</code> to execute tools.</li>
<li><strong>Message Handling:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>commitToolOutput</code>, <code>commitSystemMessage</code>, and <code>commitUserMessage</code> to manage messages.</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses the <code>bus</code> (via <code>IAgentParams</code>) to communicate with other agents.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key Concepts &amp; Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> Agents maintain their own state (conversation history, tool outputs, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Decoupling:</strong> The interfaces are designed to decouple different components of the system. This allows for flexibility and easier maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Event-Driven Architecture:</strong> The use of callbacks suggests an event-driven architecture, where components communicate through events rather than direct calls.</li>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> The interfaces highlight the importance of managing the agent's state, including conversation history, tool output, and system messages.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Integration:</strong> The <code>tools</code> property in <code>IAgentParams</code> indicates a system designed to integrate with external tools.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous Communication:</strong> Agents communicate asynchronously via a bus, allowing them to operate independently.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The system is designed to be flexible, a</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Use Cases:</strong></p>
<p>This architecture could be used for a wide range of applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chatbots:</strong>  Agents could be used to power conversational AI systems.</li>
<li><strong>Content Generation:</strong> Agents could be used to generate text, images, or other content.</li>
<li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Agents could be used to analyze data and generate insights.</li>
</ul>

You tell it which client is making the request, what pipeline you want to run, and which agent should handle it. You can also pass in some data, called a payload, which the pipeline can use to guide its actions.  The function will then promise to return a result once the pipeline has completed. Think of it as sending a command to your swarm to get a specific job done.</p>
<a id="function-scope" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function scope<a href="#function-scope" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you run a piece of code—like a function that interacts with AI agents—within a controlled environment. Think of it as creating a little sandbox where your code can operate. You provide the code you want to run, and this function handles the surrounding setup, including connecting it to the AI agents and tools it needs. You can also customize which agents and tools your code uses if you want to experiment or need specific configurations. Essentially, it simplifies running AI-powered tasks by managing the necessary connections and settings for you.</p>
<a id="function-runstatelessforce" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function runStatelessForce<a href="#function-runstatelessforce" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you run a specific instruction or message through your AI agent swarm, essentially giving it a one-off task. It's designed for situations where you don't want the message to be part of the ongoing conversation history, like when dealing with outputs that need to be processed repeatedly or for quick, isolated actions.</p>
<p>Unlike some other functions, it guarantees execution even if the agent assigned to handle it isn't actively working at that moment. It takes the instruction itself as text, plus a unique identifier for the client making the request. The system handles the behind-the-scenes work of validating everything, tracking performance, and ensuring a clean working environment for the agent.</p>
<a id="function-runstateless" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function runStateless<a href="#function-runstateless" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you quickly run a command or instruction with a specific agent in your swarm, without adding it to the agent’s ongoing conversation history. Think of it as sending a one-off message for tasks like processing data or handling output – it’s helpful when you don't want to clutter the chat log.</p>
<p>It verifies that the agent is available and active before carrying out the request. The function executes the given content in a fresh environment, tracks how long it takes, and alerts other parts of the system about what's happening. If the agent has been replaced with a different one since the session started, the function will skip the execution.</p>
<p>You provide the content you want executed, a unique identifier for the client making the request, and the name of the agent you want to use. The function then returns the result of the execution.</p>
<a id="function-questionforce" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function questionForce<a href="#function-questionforce" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you directly trigger a question-answering process, even if it's not naturally arising from a conversation. Think of it as a way to force the AI agents to consider a specific question within a defined knowledge base (the wiki). You provide the actual question you want answered, a unique identifier for who's asking (the client), and the name of the wiki containing the relevant information. The function will then return the AI agents' response to that forced question.</p>
<a id="function-question" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function question<a href="#function-question" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you send a question to the AI agent swarm for processing. It takes the actual question as a string, along with information about who's asking (a client ID), which agent is responsible for handling it, and the specific knowledge base (wiki) it should use. The function then returns a promise that will eventually resolve with the answer received from the agents. Think of it as the main way to get answers from your AI agent team.</p>
<a id="function-overridewiki" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideWiki<a href="#function-overridewiki" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you update a wiki's configuration within the swarm system. You can provide a new or partial schema to change how a specific wiki operates. Think of it as making adjustments to a wiki’s settings – like changing its permissions or structure – without affecting other parts of the system. The function creates a separate, isolated environment for these changes to ensure they don't interfere with anything else happening. It also keeps a record of the update if logging is turned on. You provide the new or updated schema details as input, and the function takes care of applying those changes to the relevant wiki.</p>
<a id="function-overridetool" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideTool<a href="#function-overridetool" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you modify how a tool behaves within the AI agent swarm. Think of it as a way to tweak an existing tool's definition, perhaps to adjust its capabilities or how it interacts with the system. You provide a partial schema – only the parts you want to change – and the function applies those updates. It's designed to be a clean operation, ensuring it doesn’t interfere with other processes. The system will keep a record of this modification if logging is turned on.</p>
<a id="function-overrideswarm" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideSwarm<a href="#function-overrideswarm" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you change the settings of a swarm already running in the system. Think of it as updating a swarm's blueprint – you can provide a new or partial set of instructions. It makes these changes directly, ensuring a fresh start without interfering with any ongoing work.  You can adjust things like the number of agents or their specific roles. The system keeps a record of these changes if logging is turned on. The <code>swarmSchema</code> parameter is where you specify the new or modified settings.</p>

Think of it as the conductor of an AI orchestra. It keeps track of which agent is currently active, manages how agents are switched between, and handles the flow of information – specifically, the output from those agents.</p>
<p>It keeps a record of which agents are available and where they are in a sequence of actions (a &quot;navigation stack&quot;). When an agent produces output, it’s broadcast to any listeners. It also provides ways to cancel operations and update the available agents.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of what it does:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manages Active Agent:</strong> It knows which agent is currently performing a task and can switch between them.</li>
<li><strong>Handles Output:</strong> It collects output from agents and sends it to those who need it.  You can also cancel this output.</li>
<li><strong>Keeps a History:</strong> It tracks the sequence of agents used, allowing you to go back and repeat steps.</li>
<li><strong>Updates in Real-Time:</strong> Notifications are sent whenever an agent is changed or output is available.</li>
<li><strong>Clean Up:</strong> It can gracefully shut down, ensuring resources are released when no longer needed.</li>

Think of it as a central repository for your agent’s data.</p>
<p>It allows you to add, update, and remove data, and importantly, it uses embeddings – a special representation of your data – to find items that are similar to each other.  This makes searching for related information much faster and more effective.</p>
<p>The class keeps track of all the data in a map for quick access. All changes to the data, like adding, removing, or updating, are handled in a controlled, sequential order to prevent conflicts.</p>
<p>You can search for items using a search term, and it will return the most similar matches.  It also provides a way to list all the data, optionally filtering it based on specific criteria. When an item is fetched or modified, the system notifies other parts of the swarm to keep everyone in sync. Finally, it includes a cleanup process to ensure everything is properly shut down when the storage is no longer needed.</p>
<a id="class-clientstate" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class ClientState<a href="#class-clientstate" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The ClientState class manages a single piece of data within a larger system of AI agents. Think of it as a container for information, equipped to handle changes and ensure those changes are handled safely and reliably.</p>
<p>It's designed to work closely with other parts of the system, like the services that create and connect to state, the agents that use that state to make decisions, and the communication channels that broadcast changes.</p>
<p>You can think of it as having a few key functions: getting the current data, updating the data, and ensuring that those updates happen in a controlled way. It handles things like tracking changes, applying extra processing steps (middleware), and informing other parts of the system when something changes. Finally, when it’s no longer needed, it cleans up after itself to release resources properly.</p>
<a id="class-clientsession" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class ClientSession<a href="#class-clientsession" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>ClientSession</code> is essentially the central manager for a client's interaction with the AI agent swarm. It handles everything from sending messages to the agents, validating those messages, and keeping track of the conversation history. Think of it as a dedicated workspace for a client engaging with the swarm.</p>
<p>When a client sends a message, the <code>ClientSession</code> first checks if the message is valid. If it's good, it sends it to the appropriate agent within the swarm for processing. You can also use it to send notifications, like quick updates, without full processing.</p>
<p>For more complex interactions, the <code>ClientSession</code> lets you run commands, commit tool outputs, and even flush the entire history to reset the session. It seamlessly integrates with other parts of the system to manage connections, agent interactions, and event logging, making sure everything runs smoothly and securely. Finally, it provides a way to connect the session to a message connector to enable real-time communication.

Think of it as a messenger service that allows different parts of the system to notify each other about important happenings. It manages subscriptions – who cares about what – and emissions – what's being announced.</p>
<p>It allows different agents to &quot;subscribe&quot; to specific events, ensuring they only receive notifications they're interested in. These subscriptions can even be set up as &quot;wildcards,&quot; meaning they're open to all events of a certain type. The service also allows for one-time subscriptions using the <code>once</code> function.</p>
<p>When something noteworthy happens (like an execution starting or ending), the <code>emit</code> function broadcasts it to all the relevant subscribers. The system validates that the sender is authorized before sending the message, ensuring security and proper access control.</p>
<p>The <code>commitExecutionBegin</code> and <code>commitExecutionEnd</code> functions are shortcuts for emitting specific execution-related events.</p>
<p>Finally, when a client’s work is complete, the <code>dispose</code> function cleans up all the subscriptions associated with that client, preventing unnecessary resource consumption. The whole system logs its operations for debugging and monitoring.</p>

Think of it as defining a specific workflow—a &quot;pipeline&quot;—where different agents pass information to each other to accomplish a larger task.</p>
<p>Each pipeline gets a name to easily identify it.</p>
<p>The core of the pipeline is the <code>execute</code> function; this is what actually runs the sequence of agents, taking a client identifier, the agent's name, and some data (the <code>payload</code>) as input. It then handles the process and can return a result or simply complete the task.</p>
<p>Finally, you can define optional callback functions to be notified at different stages of the pipeline’s execution—allowing you to track progress and handle events as they happen.</p>

Think of it as a way to be notified about what’s happening. You’re provided with callbacks for when a pipeline starts, finishes (successfully or with an error), and when an error occurs during execution. Each callback gives you details like the client that initiated the pipeline, the pipeline's name, any data passed along, and if it's an error, the error itself. This enables you to build custom monitoring, logging, or even automated reaction systems based on pipeline events.</p>

Think of it as the standard format for communication between agents, tools, users, and the core system.</p>
<p>Each message has a <code>role</code> indicating who or what sent it – whether it’s a direct response from the model (<code>assistant</code>), a system notification (<code>system</code>), output from a tool (<code>tool</code>), user input (<code>user</code>), or something related to error recovery (<code>resque</code> or <code>flush</code>).  The <code>agentName</code> tells you which agent is responsible for the message. The <code>content</code> is the actual text or data being transmitted.</p>
<p>The <code>mode</code> property clarifies whether the message originated from a user or a tool, influencing how it’s processed.  If a model is requesting tool execution, <code>tool_calls</code> holds the details of those calls.  <code>images</code> allows for including images.  <code>tool_call_id</code> links a tool’s response back to the original tool call request, and <code>payload</code> allows you to attach extra contextual data.</p>

<a id="interface-icomputeconnectionservice" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IComputeConnectionService<a href="#interface-icomputeconnectionservice" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how your AI agents connect to and interact with external compute resources, like databases, APIs, or other services. Think of it as the bridge that lets your agents access the tools they need to do their work. It provides methods for establishing connections, ensuring they remain active, and gracefully handling any disconnections that might occur. By implementing this interface, you can create reusable connection components that your agents can utilize consistently across different tasks and environments, promoting modularity and simplifying maintenance. Essentially, it's the foundation for enabling agents to reliably access and leverage external data and functionality.</p>

Think of it as a way to be notified about what's happening behind the scenes.</p>
<p>You can define functions to be called when a compute unit is first created (<code>onInit</code>), when it’s being cleaned up (<code>onDispose</code>), when it's actively performing its calculations (<code>onCompute</code>), when a specific calculation is starting (<code>onCalculate</code>), and when its state is updated (<code>onUpdate</code>). Each of these callbacks provides information like the client ID and the name of the compute unit involved, allowing you to react to and potentially influence the process.</p>
<a id="interface-icompute" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface ICompute<a href="#interface-icompute" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>ICompute</code> interface defines the core actions available for managing computational tasks within the agent swarm. It lets you trigger calculations using <code>calculate</code>, specifying which state to focus on. You can also use <code>update</code> to inform the system about changes to a specific computation, identified by a client ID and compute name. Finally, <code>getComputeData</code> provides a way to retrieve the current status or data associated with a computation. This interface simplifies interaction with the computation layer of the orchestration framework.</p>
<a id="interface-icompletionschema" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface ICompletionSchema<a href="#interface-icompletionschema" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface outlines how to set up a system for generating suggestions or completions within your agent swarm. Think of it as defining a specific way for agents to produce responses.</p>
<p>You're able to give each completion method a unique name and specify flags to be used with the underlying language model—like telling the model how to behave or what style to use.</p>
<p>You can also customize what happens after a completion is generated by providing callback functions.</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>getCompletion</code> method is the key to actually requesting a completion; it takes some arguments and returns a model's response, integrating the context and available tools into the process.</p>
<a id="interface-icompletioncallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface ICompletionCallbacks<a href="#interface-icompletioncallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you tap into what happens after an AI agent successfully finishes a task. Specifically, <code>onComplete</code> provides a way to be notified when a completion is ready, giving you a chance to do things like record the results, format the output, or initiate the next step in a workflow. You can think of it as a way to react to the successful completion of an AI agent's work.</p>
<a id="interface-icompletionargs" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface ICompletionArgs<a href="#interface-icompletionargs" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the information needed to ask the AI agent swarm to generate a response. Think of it as a package of data that includes who's asking (client ID and agent name), where the last message came from (user or a tool), the ongoing conversation history, and a list of tools the agent can use to help it respond. It essentially structures the context for the AI to understand what's being asked and how to best answer. Providing these details ensures the AI generates a relevant and informed response within the overall workflow.</p>
<a id="interface-icompletion" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface ICompletion<a href="#interface-icompletion" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how your AI agents can request and receive responses from language models. Think of it as a standardized way for agents to ask a model a question and get an answer back. It’s designed to be a full and clear blueprint for how agents interact with models, ensuring a consistent and predictable process.</p>
<a id="interface-iclientperfomancerecord" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IClientPerfomanceRecord<a href="#interface-iclientperfomancerecord" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface tracks performance details for individual clients, like user sessions or agent instances, within a larger process. It collects information about how much data a client is processing, how long its operations take, and what state it’s holding.</p>
<p>Each client record includes a unique identifier (<code>clientId</code>) to link performance data back to a specific instance. It also stores the client’s memory and state (<code>sessionMemory</code>, <code>sessionState</code>), which are similar to what you’re using in your agents.</p>
<p>The record also logs the number of operations (<code>executionCount</code>), the total input and output data sizes (<code>executionInputTotal</code>, <code>executionOutputTotal</code>), and average execution times (<code>executionTimeAverage</code>). The total input, output, and time are also tracked to provide aggregated views. This helps understand how each client contributes to the overall performance of the system.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatinstancecallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatInstanceCallbacks<a href="#interface-ichatinstancecallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines a set of callbacks that allow you to listen for and react to events happening within a chat instance managed by the AI agent swarm. You can use these callbacks to monitor the lifecycle of a chat, from its initialization to when messages are sent.</p>
<p>Specifically, you're notified when a chat instance becomes active or inactive, when it's ready to use, and when it's finished. You also receive notifications when a new chat session starts and when a message is transmitted. This allows your application to respond dynamically to the chat's progress and state.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatinstance" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatInstance<a href="#interface-ichatinstance" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface represents a single chat session within your AI agent swarm. Think of it as a dedicated space for one conversation.</p>
<p>The <code>beginChat</code> method kicks off a new chat, while <code>sendMessage</code> lets you send messages to the other side. To ensure the chat remains active, <code>checkLastActivity</code> verifies if there's been recent interaction. When you’re finished, <code>dispose</code> cleanly shuts down the chat session. Finally, <code>listenDispose</code> allows you to be notified when a chat is being closed.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatcontrol" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatControl<a href="#interface-ichatcontrol" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you configure how your AI agent swarm interacts with chat interfaces. Think of it as a way to plug in different chat systems or customize their behavior.</p>
<p><code>useChatAdapter</code> allows you to specify which type of chat instance you want to use – essentially telling the framework what kind of chat technology is handling the conversations.</p>
<p><code>useChatCallbacks</code> lets you define specific actions that should happen at different points in the chat process, like when a message is received or sent. This gives you fine-grained control over how the swarm responds to events.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatargs" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatArgs<a href="#interface-ichatargs" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface, <code>IChatArgs</code>, defines the structure of data used when communicating with an AI agent within the system. Think of it as a standard package for sending information to an agent. It includes a <code>clientId</code> to identify who initiated the conversation, an <code>agentName</code> specifying which agent is responsible for the chat, and the actual <code>message</code> content being sent. This ensures all necessary information is provided for a meaningful interaction.</p>
<a id="interface-ibuseventcontext" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBusEventContext<a href="#interface-ibuseventcontext" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface provides extra information about events happening within the system. Think of it as a way to label events with details about which agent, swarm, storage, state, compute, or policy is involved. When an agent sends an event, it typically only includes its own name (agentName). However, other parts of the system might use this interface to provide more complete information about events related to swarms, storage, states, computations, or policies. It helps track down exactly what's happening and where within the overall system.</p>
<a id="interface-ibusevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBusEvent<a href="#interface-ibusevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface describes the structure of messages sent across the system's internal communication channels. Think of it as a standardized way for different parts of the system, especially agents, to talk to each other and signal what's happening.</p>
<p>Each message always comes from a known source, usually the agent bus, and has a specific type, like &quot;run&quot; or &quot;commit-user-message,&quot; indicating what action is being communicated. It can also carry input data—information needed to perform an action—and output data—the results of that action. Finally, there's contextual information attached, like the agent's name, which helps identify where the message originated. Essentially, it's a detailed record of what an agent is doing and sharing with the rest of the swarm.</p>
<a id="interface-ibus" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBus<a href="#interface-ibus" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>IBus</code> interface acts like a central messaging system for the swarm. It allows different parts of the system, particularly agents, to send updates and information to specific clients. Think of it as a way for agents to announce things like when a task is finished, a message has been processed, or a tool has produced a result.</p>
<p>The main function, <code>emit</code>, is how you send these messages. You specify which client the message is intended for and then provide the event details, which includes things like the event type, data, and the agent that sent it. The system makes sure the message gets to the right place and handles it asynchronously.</p>
<p>These messages often contain information that other parts of the system need to know, such as the result of a tool execution or the completion of a process. The <code>clientId</code> is included in the message itself for extra clarity and to help ensure the message reaches the correct recipient. This system allows different agents to talk to clients without needing to know the specifics of how the other is implemented.</p>
<a id="interface-ibaseevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBaseEvent<a href="#interface-ibaseevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lays the groundwork for how different parts of the system talk to each other through events. Every event generated within the swarm will have at least these two pieces of information: a <code>source</code> indicating where the event came from, and a <code>clientId</code> specifying which client it's meant for. Think of the <code>source</code> as a label saying who sent the message, and the <code>clientId</code> as the address it's being sent to – making sure it reaches the right place. This provides a standard way for agents, sessions, and other components to communicate.</p>
<a id="interface-iagenttoolcallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentToolCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagenttoolcallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you plug into the lifecycle of individual tools within your AI agent swarm. Think of it as a way to observe and subtly influence what each tool does.</p>
<p>You can use <code>onBeforeCall</code> to do things like log when a tool is about to run or prepare some data. <code>onAfterCall</code> is for tasks you want to perform after a tool has finished, maybe cleanup or more detailed logging.</p>
<p><code>onValidate</code> gives you the power to check if the information passed to a tool is correct before it even starts running, preventing errors. Finally, <code>onCallError</code> handles situations where a tool fails, so you can log the error or attempt some kind of recovery. Each of these callbacks are optional, giving you flexibility in how much control you need.</p>
<a id="interface-iagenttool" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentTool<a href="#interface-iagenttool" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface describes a tool that an AI agent can use, building upon a more general tool definition. Each tool has a name, a description for documentation, and a way to validate incoming parameters to ensure they’re correct before the tool runs.</p>
<p>You can also add validation logic that can be performed synchronously or asynchronously, depending on the complexity. To give you more control, there are optional callbacks that allow you to customize the tool's execution process at different stages.</p>
<p>The core functionality is the <code>call</code> method, which actually executes the tool. It takes all the necessary information, including parameters and context, to perform its task. Finally, the <code>function</code> property allows for dynamic generation of the tool metadata.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemainternalcallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaInternalCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagentschemainternalcallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you tap into key moments in an agent's lifecycle. You can use these callbacks to monitor what's happening, log events, or even react to specific actions.</p>
<p>For example, <code>onRun</code> tells you when an agent is executing a stateless operation, while <code>onExecute</code> signals the start of a more involved process.  <code>onToolOutput</code> lets you know when a tool has generated a result, and <code>onToolRequest</code> is useful for intercepting and potentially modifying tool requests.</p>
<p>Other callbacks like <code>onSystemMessage</code>, <code>onAssistantMessage</code>, <code>onUserMessage</code>, <code>onFlush</code>, and <code>onOutput</code> give you visibility into communication and data flow.  <code>onResurrect</code> alerts you to an agent recovering from a pause or error, and <code>onInit</code> &amp; <code>onDispose</code> mark the beginning and end of the agent’s existence. Finally, <code>onAfterToolCalls</code> provides notification upon completion of a sequence of tool executions.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemainternal" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaInternal<a href="#interface-iagentschemainternal" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface describes how an agent is configured within the system. It essentially defines everything about an agent – its name, the instructions it follows (the prompt), the tools it can use, and how it interacts with the overall process.</p>
<p>You can set a limit on the number of tools an agent can use in a single cycle, as well as control how much conversation history it remembers to keep its responses relevant. It also allows for adding helpful descriptions for documentation and whether it acts as an operator.</p>
<p>The system lets you specify prompts that guide the agent's behavior, and even allows for dynamic prompts that change based on the context of the conversation.  You can also define how the agent handles tool calls, validates its outputs, and transforms the model's responses. Finally, you can define connection to operator, available tools and storage, define the agents' states and dependencies, and hook into the agent's lifecycle with custom callbacks to tailor its behavior.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemacallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagentschemacallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you hook into different moments in an agent's lifecycle. You can use these callbacks to monitor what's happening, log events, or even react to specific actions the agent takes. For example, you can get notified when the agent starts running, when it asks a tool to do something, or when it finishes producing an output. It's a way to observe and interact with your agents without directly modifying their core logic. The callbacks provide context like the agent's ID, name, and relevant data associated with each event.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschema" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchema<a href="#interface-iagentschema" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the structure for describing an agent within the orchestration framework. It allows you to specify instructions or guidelines for an agent, which helps guide its behavior and interactions. You can provide a standard set of system prompts using the <code>system</code> property, and <code>systemStatic</code> acts as an alias for <code>system</code>. For more complex scenarios, the <code>systemDynamic</code> property lets you generate system prompts on the fly based on the client ID and agent name, which gives you more flexibility.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentparams" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentParams<a href="#interface-iagentparams" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how an agent is set up to run within the system. Think of it as a configuration package that provides the agent with everything it needs to operate – its unique identifier, a way to log its actions, a communication channel with other agents, access to external tools, a record of past interactions, and the ability to generate responses. It also allows you to define tools the agent can use and even include a validation step to ensure the output is correct before it's finalized.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentnavigationparams" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentNavigationParams<a href="#interface-iagentnavigationparams" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the settings you use to tell an agent how to move around and interact with other agents within the system. You specify the name of the tool being created, a description of what it does, and the specific agent it should navigate towards. There's also a space for an optional note to add extra documentation about the tool. Think of it as setting the destination and instructions for an agent's movement.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentconnectionservice" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentConnectionService<a href="#interface-iagentconnectionservice" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface helps define how different agents connect and communicate within the system. It’s essentially a blueprint for creating connection services, but it’s designed to strip away the internal details so that the public-facing parts are clear and consistent. Think of it as ensuring everyone uses the same language when agents are talking to each other.</p>
<a id="interface-iagent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgent<a href="#interface-iagent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>IAgent</code> interface describes how an agent operates within the orchestration framework. Think of it as the blueprint for how an agent processes information and interacts.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>run</code> method for quick, isolated tests—it lets you give the agent input and get a result without changing its memory. The <code>execute</code> method handles the full process, potentially updating the agent’s history based on how it’s configured.</p>
<p>To manage the agent’s memory, there are several <code>commit...</code> methods. These allow you to add different types of messages—tool outputs, system instructions, user inputs, assistant responses—to the agent's record. You can also use methods like <code>commitToolRequest</code> to log tool calls and <code>commitFlush</code> to completely reset the agent’s memory. The <code>commitStopTools</code>, <code>commitAgentChange</code>, and <code>commitCancelOutput</code> methods give you fine-grained control over stopping the agent’s current actions and preventing future ones.</p>
