<p><strong>Overall Architecture:</strong></p>
<p>This system built around a distributed, asynchronous architecture. Agents communicate via a message queue, and their interactions are orchestrated through a series of tools and processes. The core concept is to allow agents to perform tasks independently while still being part of a larger, coordinated system.</p>
<p><strong>Core Concepts &amp; Relationships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swarm Orchestration:</strong> The entire framework is built around orchestrating agents to perform tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Agent as the Central Unit:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> is the fundamental building block – the individual agent that executes tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Communication (Bus):</strong> The <code>IAgentParams</code> interface highlights the importance of the <code>bus</code> (a messaging system) for agents to communicate and coordinate.</li>
<li><strong>History Management:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> and <code>IAgentParams</code> emphasize the agent's ability to operate without relying on conversation history (using the <code>run</code> method).</li>
<li><strong>Tool Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>call</code> and <code>execute</code> methods are central to running tools within the agent.</li>
<li><strong>Schema &amp; Configuration:</strong> The <code>IAgentSchema</code> defines the configuration for each agent, including its tools, prompt, and completion mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interface Breakdown &amp; Key Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a summary of each interface and its role:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>IAgent</code>:</strong> The core runtime agent.  Handles independent execution, tool calls, message commitment, and lifecycle management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentParams</code>:</strong>  Provides the agent with the necessary parameters for operation, including its ID, logging, communication channel, and history management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchema</code>:</strong> Defines the configuration settings for an agent (tools, prompt, completion mechanism).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchemaCallbacks</code>:</strong>  Provides callbacks for managing different stages of an agent’s lifecycle (init, run, output, etc.).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentConnectionService</code>:</strong> A type definition for an <code>AgentConnectionService</code> – a service that manages connections between the agents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Workflow Implications</strong></p>
<p>Based on these interfaces, here’s a workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Agent Configuration:</strong> An <code>IAgentSchema</code> is created to define the agent’s settings.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Instantiation:</strong> An <code>IAgent</code> instance is created based on the schema.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>execute</code> method is called to initiate independent operation.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Calls:</strong>  The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>call</code> to execute tools.</li>
<li><strong>Message Handling:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>commitToolOutput</code>, <code>commitSystemMessage</code>, and <code>commitUserMessage</code> to manage messages.</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses the <code>bus</code> (via <code>IAgentParams</code>) to communicate with other agents.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key Concepts &amp; Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> Agents maintain their own state (conversation history, tool outputs, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Decoupling:</strong> The interfaces are designed to decouple different components of the system. This allows for flexibility and easier maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Event-Driven Architecture:</strong> The use of callbacks suggests an event-driven architecture, where components communicate through events rather than direct calls.</li>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> The interfaces highlight the importance of managing the agent's state, including conversation history, tool output, and system messages.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Integration:</strong> The <code>tools</code> property in <code>IAgentParams</code> indicates a system designed to integrate with external tools.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous Communication:</strong> Agents communicate asynchronously via a bus, allowing them to operate independently.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The system is designed to be flexible, a</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Use Cases:</strong></p>
<p>This architecture could be used for a wide range of applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chatbots:</strong>  Agents could be used to power conversational AI systems.</li>
<li><strong>Content Generation:</strong> Agents could be used to generate text, images, or other content.</li>
<li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Agents could be used to analyze data and generate insights.</li>

Think of it as a quality control system for your knowledge base.</p>
<p>You start by defining the structure each wiki should follow – this is done by adding a wiki schema using the <code>addWiki</code> function. Then, when you have new content for a wiki, you can use the <code>validate</code> function to check if it matches the defined schema. The service also keeps track of the wikis you’ve added internally.  It uses a logging service to record any issues found during validation, making debugging easier.</p>
<a id="class-wikischemaservice" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class WikiSchemaService<a href="#class-wikischemaservice" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>WikiSchemaService</code> helps manage and organize different wiki schema definitions within the system. Think of it as a central repository where you store and access blueprints for how your wikis should be structured.</p>
<p>You can register new schema blueprints using <code>register</code>, associating each with a unique key for easy identification. If a schema already exists, <code>override</code> allows you to update specific parts of it without replacing the entire definition. When you need a particular schema, <code>get</code> retrieves it quickly by its key.</p>
<p>The service also relies on a logging system (<code>loggerService</code>) and a registry to keep track of available schemas, and offers shallow validation for initial schema checks.</p>
<a id="class-toolvalidationservice" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class ToolValidationService<a href="#class-toolvalidationservice" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This service helps ensure that the tools your AI agents are using are properly configured and registered within the swarm. It keeps track of all the tools the system knows about, making sure there aren't any duplicates and that they actually exist.</p>
<p>It works closely with other parts of the system like the tool registration service, agent validation, and logging. When you add a new tool, this service registers it and makes sure it's unique. When an agent needs to use a tool, it uses this service to confirm that the tool is properly set up. To make things efficient, the validation checks are cached so they don't have to be repeated unnecessarily.</p>
<a id="class-toolschemaservice" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class ToolSchemaService<a href="#class-toolschemaservice" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The ToolSchemaService manages the definitions of tools used by agents within the swarm. Think of it as a central library where all the tool blueprints are stored and accessed. It ensures these blueprints are structurally sound before they're used.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of what it does:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tool Registry:</strong> This service acts as a registry, keeping track of all available tools. It uses a specialized storage system for efficient access.</li>
<li><strong>Schema Validation:</strong>  Before a tool can be used, the service checks its basic structure to make sure it's complete and valid.</li>
<li><strong>Registration:</strong> You can add new tool definitions to the registry through this service.</li>
<li><strong>Retrieval:</strong>  It allows other parts of the system to easily find and use the definitions of existing tools.</li>
<li><strong>Overriding:</strong>  It provides a way to update existing tool definitions, allowing for changes and improvements over time.</li>
<li><strong>Logging:</strong> The service logs important actions, providing insights into how tools are being managed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This service is a foundational component, used by various services to ensure agents have the correct tools and their definitions are consistent.</p>
<a id="class-toolabortcontroller" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class ToolAbortController<a href="#class-toolabortcontroller" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The ToolAbortController helps you manage how tasks are stopped if needed. It’s like a little helper that lets you create and control an AbortController, which is a standard way to signal that something should be cancelled mid-process.</p>
<p>Inside, it holds an AbortController – essentially the control panel for stopping things – and if that control panel isn’t available in your environment, it’s simply absent.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>abort</code> function to actually trigger the cancellation signal. If there's no AbortController available, calling <code>abort</code> won't cause any problems; it’s safe to use even if the underlying functionality isn't present.</p>

It keeps track of all registered swarms and their associated details, like agent lists and policies.</p>
<p>Adding a new swarm involves registering it with this service, and it makes sure each swarm has a unique name. You can then retrieve lists of agents and policies assigned to specific swarms.</p>
<p>The <code>validate</code> function is the workhorse; it checks a swarm's configuration to make sure everything is set up correctly, reusing previous checks for efficiency. This helps maintain the overall health and reliability of your swarm system. It relies on other services to handle agent and policy validation, logging operations, and managing swarm registrations.</p>
<a id="class-swarmschemaservice" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class SwarmSchemaService<a href="#class-swarmschemaservice" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The SwarmSchemaService is the central place where the blueprints for your AI agent swarms are stored and managed. Think of it as a library of configurations, each defining how a group of agents should work together. It ensures these configurations are well-formed and consistent before they're used.</p>
<p>It keeps track of swarm schemas, using a registry to efficiently store and find them. When you add a new schema or update an existing one, it performs a quick check to make sure everything looks right. Logging is enabled for these operations to help with troubleshooting.</p>
<p>This service works closely with other components like the connection service, agent connection service, and policy schema service to enable a coordinated and reliable AI agent orchestration system. It allows you to easily define and retrieve the configurations needed for your AI agent swarms, making it a core part of the system's architecture. You can think of it as defining the ‘recipe’ for how your agents will operate.</p>

It provides a set of methods that allow you to send messages, control output, manage agents, and ultimately shut down the swarm, all while ensuring that these actions are tracked and associated with a specific client and swarm. Think of it as a public API built on top of more internal services, ensuring operations are handled consistently and with proper context.</p>
<p>It provides ways to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Send messages:</strong> You can broadcast messages to the swarm for a particular client.</li>
<li><strong>Control agent flow:</strong> Manage the agent stack (popping agents, setting the current agent, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Handle output:</strong> You can wait for output from the swarm or cancel any pending output.</li>
<li><strong>Manage agents:</strong> Retrieve agent details or set agent references within the swarm.</li>
<li><strong>Clean up:</strong> Properly dispose of the swarm and its resources when finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>This class is designed to be used by other components, like client agents or agent-specific services, providing a standardized and controlled way to interact with the overall swarm system. It’s all about providing a safe and tracked way to work with the agents and ensure consistent behavior.</p>
<a id="class-swarmmetaservice" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class SwarmMetaService<a href="#class-swarmmetaservice" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This service helps organize and visualize the structure of your AI agent swarms. It takes the raw information about a swarm – its agents, their relationships, and overall design – and transforms it into a diagram using UML notation. Think of it as a tool to create clear, understandable blueprints of your swarm systems.</p>
<p>It relies on other services to pull in the necessary data, like how agents are defined and what their roles are.  It builds a tree-like representation of the swarm and then converts that into a UML diagram. This makes it much easier to document, debug, and understand how your swarms are put together. The diagrams produced can be automatically generated and integrated into documentation.</p>

It efficiently handles creating and reusing swarm connections, caching them to avoid unnecessary setup. Think of it as a gatekeeper for your swarm environments.</p>
<p>It works closely with other components like agent management, session linking, and performance tracking, ensuring smooth operation and logging key events. It automatically retrieves configuration data for each swarm and manages agent instances.</p>
<p>Key functions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Getting a Swarm:</strong> This is the primary way to connect to a specific swarm environment. It retrieves or creates a connection, optimizing performance through caching.</li>
<li><strong>Emitting Messages:</strong> Allows sending asynchronous messages to the active session within the swarm.</li>
<li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Provides ways to move between agents within a swarm, popping from a navigation stack or returning to a default agent.</li>
<li><strong>Output Control:</strong>  Handles waiting for and cancelling agent output, enabling control over agent interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Information:</strong> Retrieves information about the currently active agent, including its name and instance.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Management:</strong>  Allows setting agent references and names to manage the active agent within the swarm.</li>
<li><strong>Cleanup:</strong> Properly disposes of the swarm connection and clears cached instances when finished.</li>

It essentially acts as a central authority for storage configurations.</p>
<p>When a new storage system is added, this service registers it and ensures that no two systems have the same name. It then performs validation checks, including verifying the setup of the embeddings associated with each storage.</p>
<p>To improve performance, the validation process is optimized so it doesn't need to re-check configurations unnecessarily. The service integrates with other components to manage storage registration, perform operations, and log any issues.</p>
<a id="class-storageutils" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class StorageUtils<a href="#class-storageutils" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This class helps manage how data is stored and accessed for individual clients and their agents within the system. It provides tools to get, add, update, and delete storage items, ensuring that the right agents have permission to work with the data they need.</p>
<p>You can use it to retrieve a limited number of items based on a search query, or to add or update data in storage.  It also allows you to remove items by their unique ID, retrieve specific items, list all items, and even clear out entire storage areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it can generate numeric indexes to keep track of the number of items in a storage area and provides a way to completely empty a storage area for a given client and agent. Before any action, it confirms that the client is authorized and that the agent is properly registered for the storage they're trying to use.</p>

These states define how agents interact with data and each other. It makes sure these configurations are valid and easy to find.</p>
<p>Think of it this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>It keeps track of all the different state setups, allowing other services to easily access them.</li>
<li>It checks new state setups to ensure they're properly formatted before adding them to the registry.</li>
<li>If something changes, you can update an existing state setup without having to create a brand new one.</li>
<li>It logs these actions, so you can monitor what’s happening with your state configurations.</li>
</ul>
<p>This service works closely with other components, such as the connection and configuration services, to provide a consistent and reliable state management system for the agent swarm.</p>

It helps organize and control how state is created, updated, and cleaned up, especially when dealing with states specific to individual clients.</p>
<p>Think of it as a smart cache; it remembers frequently used state information to avoid repeated work. When you need to access or modify state, this service first checks if it already has the information readily available. If not, it creates it, potentially fetching configurations and persisting data along the way.</p>
<p>It also handles situations where the state is shared among multiple clients, delegating those operations to another service. Importantly, it tracks which states are shared to avoid accidentally cleaning them up prematurely.</p>
<p>The service also keeps an eye on things, tracking how state is used and ensuring that operations are performed safely and efficiently. Logging helps to trace what's happening, and the whole process is designed to work in sync with other system components. When a client is finished, this service cleans up its associated state information, freeing up resources.</p>

<p>Think of it as the main way external components (like the client agent) talk to the underlying agent system. Every action—from executing a command to committing a message—is carefully managed, often with logging to track what's happening.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of what you can do with this service:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create Agents:</strong> Get a reference to a specific agent for a given client and method.</li>
<li><strong>Execute Commands:</strong> Run a command on an agent with a specific mode.</li>
<li><strong>Run Quick Completions:</strong>  Execute a stateless completion on the agent.</li>
<li><strong>Manage History:</strong> Add user messages, assistant responses, tool outputs, system prompts, and flushes to the agent's conversation history.</li>
<li><strong>Control Execution:</strong> Stop tool executions or prevent subsequent tools from running.</li>
<li><strong>Clean Up:</strong> Properly dispose of an agent to release resources.</li>
</ul>

<a id="interface-iclientperfomancerecord" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IClientPerfomanceRecord<a href="#interface-iclientperfomancerecord" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface tracks the performance details for individual clients, like user sessions or agent instances, within a larger process. It provides a way to understand how each client is performing, not just the overall system.</p>
<p>Each client has a unique identifier (<code>clientId</code>) allowing you to correlate performance data to a specific session or agent. The <code>sessionMemory</code> and <code>sessionState</code> properties store temporary data and persistent configuration information for each client, similar to how an agent manages its internal state.</p>
<p>You’re also able to measure how much data is being processed (<code>executionInputTotal</code>, <code>executionOutputTotal</code>), as well as average sizes and total execution times for a complete picture of client-level performance. The time values are provided as strings for easy readability.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatinstancecallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatInstanceCallbacks<a href="#interface-ichatinstancecallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines a set of callbacks that allow you to react to events happening within a chat instance managed by the AI agent swarm orchestration framework. You can use these callbacks to monitor the lifecycle of a chat, from its initialization to when it’s finished, and to be notified when messages are sent.</p>
<p>Specifically, you'll get notified when a chat instance starts up (<code>onInit</code>), when it's finished and cleaned up (<code>onDispose</code>), when a new chat session begins (<code>onBeginChat</code>), and when a message is sent during the chat (<code>onSendMessage</code>). You can also use <code>onCheckActivity</code> to keep track of whether a client is still active in the swarm and when they last interacted.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatinstance" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatInstance<a href="#interface-ichatinstance" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface represents a single chat session within the agent swarm. It provides methods to start a chat, send messages, and check for activity to keep the session alive. You can also use it to clean up resources when the chat is no longer needed through the <code>dispose</code> method. Finally, if you want to be notified when a chat session is closed, you can register a listener to receive dispose events.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatcontrol" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatControl<a href="#interface-ichatcontrol" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This framework lets you define how your AI agents communicate and collaborate.</p>
<p>The <code>IChatControl</code> interface provides a way to customize the underlying chat functionality. You can specify which class will be used to create chat instances with <code>useChatAdapter</code>, essentially choosing the engine powering the agent conversations.</p>
<p>Additionally, <code>useChatCallbacks</code> allows you to hook into specific events happening within the chat process, giving you more fine-grained control over how the agents interact. This lets you tailor the communication flow to your specific needs.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatargs" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatArgs<a href="#interface-ichatargs" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>IChatArgs</code> interface defines the information needed to initiate a chat with an agent. It includes a <code>clientId</code> which uniquely identifies the client sending the message. You'll also specify which <code>agentName</code> should handle the conversation. Finally, the <code>message</code> property holds the actual text of what the client wants to communicate.</p>
<a id="interface-ibuseventcontext" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBusEventContext<a href="#interface-ibuseventcontext" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface provides extra details about events happening within the agent swarm system. Think of it as a way to add labels to events, helping to identify which agent, swarm, or other system components were involved. When an agent is sending information, it usually just includes its own name. However, other parts of the system might use this interface to specify details like the swarm or storage involved in a particular event. It’s a way to provide more context and traceability for what's going on.</p>
<a id="interface-ibusevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBusEvent<a href="#interface-ibusevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines a standardized way for different parts of the system to communicate events, especially within the agents themselves. Think of it as a structured message being sent around – it ensures everyone understands what's happening and why.</p>
<p>Each event includes information about where it came from (the source), what kind of event it is (the type), and any data that’s relevant – both input and output. Contextual information, like the agent’s name, is also included to provide more background. This structure makes it easier for the system to react to events and track what's going on in the swarm.</p>
<a id="interface-ibus" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBus<a href="#interface-ibus" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>IBus</code> interface provides a way for different parts of the system, especially agents, to communicate with each other asynchronously. Think of it as a central messaging system where agents can broadcast updates and information to specific clients.</p>
<p>It has one main method, <code>emit</code>, which is used to send these messages.  When an agent does something important – like completing a task, generating an output, or saving data – it uses <code>emit</code> to inform the system and, more importantly, to notify the intended client.</p>
<p>Each message, or &quot;event,&quot; follows a standard format. It includes information about what happened (the <code>type</code>), where it came from (<code>source</code>), any input data, any resulting output, and crucially, the ID of the client it's being sent to.  The client ID is repeated in the event itself for extra certainty.</p>
<p>The <code>emit</code> method returns a promise, confirming that the message has been queued for delivery, rather than being instantly guaranteed to arrive. This allows for flexible routing and processing of messages.  This helps keep the different components of the system working independently and efficiently.</p>
<a id="interface-ibaseevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBaseEvent<a href="#interface-ibaseevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface establishes a standard way for different parts of the system to communicate using events. Every event, whether it’s a core system message or a custom one, will have at least a <code>source</code> to indicate where it came from and a <code>clientId</code> to specify which client the event is intended for. Think of <code>source</code> as the department sending a message and <code>clientId</code> as the specific recipient within that department. This foundational structure helps ensure events are routed correctly and consistently across agents, sessions, and the swarm itself.</p>
<a id="interface-iagenttoolcallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentToolCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagenttoolcallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines a set of optional functions you can use to interact with and monitor the lifecycle of an agent tool. Think of these functions as hooks that let you step in before, after, or even during a tool's execution.</p>
<p>You can use <code>onBeforeCall</code> to perform tasks like logging or preparing data just before a tool runs. <code>onAfterCall</code> allows you to clean up or record results after the tool finishes.</p>
<p>If you need to ensure a tool's inputs are correct before it runs, <code>onValidate</code> lets you create custom validation logic. And if a tool encounters an error, <code>onCallError</code> provides a way to handle it gracefully, perhaps by logging the problem or attempting a retry. Each of these functions gives you more control and insight into how your agent tools are working.</p>
<a id="interface-iagenttool" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentTool<a href="#interface-iagenttool" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface describes a tool that an AI agent can use, building upon a more general tool definition. Each tool has a name for identification and an optional description to help users understand how to use it.</p>
<p>Before a tool runs, a validation step confirms whether the provided input is correct, which can happen immediately or after a short delay.</p>
<p>You can also customize a tool's behavior by providing optional lifecycle callbacks that run at different points during its execution.</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>call</code> method is how the tool actually runs, taking parameters, context information, and a signal to handle potential interruptions.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemacallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagentschemacallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you hook into different moments in an agent's lifecycle. You can set up functions to be called when an agent starts running, when a tool generates output, or when the agent produces a message – essentially giving you a way to observe and react to what's happening with each agent. There are also callbacks for less common events, like when an agent is reset or brought back online after a pause, or when its history is cleared. It provides fine-grained control and visibility into agent behavior.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschema" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchema<a href="#interface-iagentschema" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the blueprint for how each individual agent within the AI swarm operates. Think of it as a set of instructions that tells the agent what it's called, what tools it can use, and how it should behave.</p>
<p>You can give each agent a unique name and a descriptive explanation for documentation purposes. It specifies a primary prompt that guides the agent’s actions, and also allows for optional system prompts to manage things like tool usage protocols.</p>
<p>The agent can be configured with lists of tools, storage options, and dependencies on other agents. There are also functions that allow you to control the agent’s tool calls, validate its output, and even transform messages before they are processed. For agents that handle operator interactions, a special connection function is available for transferring chat sessions to an operator dashboard. Lastly, lifecycle callbacks provide a flexible way to customize the agent's execution.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentparams" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentParams<a href="#interface-iagentparams" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the information needed to run an individual agent within the AI agent swarm. Think of it as a set of instructions and resources given to each agent when it's starting up.</p>
<p>It includes things like a unique client ID to identify who’s using the agent, a logger for recording what the agent does, and a communication bus for interacting with other agents in the swarm.</p>
<p>The agent also gets a way to call external tools (via the <code>mcp</code> property), access a history of its interactions, and generate responses (<code>completion</code>). Optionally, a list of available tools can be provided.  Finally, there's a validation step that allows you to check the agent's output before it's considered finished.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentconnectionservice" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentConnectionService<a href="#interface-iagentconnectionservice" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface helps us clearly define how different agents connect and communicate within the swarm. It's a blueprint for building services that manage these connections, ensuring that only the necessary, public-facing parts are exposed. Think of it as a standardized way to build agent connection managers, keeping things organized and predictable for anyone interacting with the system. It makes sure the core workings stay hidden while providing a consistent way to connect agents.</p>
<a id="interface-iagent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgent<a href="#interface-iagent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface describes how you interact with an individual agent within the swarm. Think of it as a blueprint for how an agent behaves and responds.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>run</code> method to quickly test an agent with a given input without affecting its memory or past conversations. <code>execute</code> is used to make the agent actually process information, potentially changing its internal state. The <code>waitForOutput</code> method lets you retrieve the result after the agent has finished its work.</p>
<p>There are also methods to manage the agent's &quot;memory&quot; or history. <code>commitToolOutput</code> and <code>commitSystemMessage</code> allow you to add information that the agent will consider in future interactions. <code>commitUserMessage</code>, <code>commitAssistantMessage</code>, and <code>commitAgentChange</code> offer finer-grained control over the flow and state of the conversation. Finally, <code>commitFlush</code> lets you completely reset the agent to a fresh start, and <code>commitStopTools</code> allows you to halt ongoing tool execution.</p>
