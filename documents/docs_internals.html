<p><strong>Overall Architecture:</strong></p>
<p>This system built around a distributed, asynchronous architecture. Agents communicate via a message queue, and their interactions are orchestrated through a series of tools and processes. The core concept is to allow agents to perform tasks independently while still being part of a larger, coordinated system.</p>
<p><strong>Core Concepts &amp; Relationships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swarm Orchestration:</strong> The entire framework is built around orchestrating agents to perform tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Agent as the Central Unit:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> is the fundamental building block – the individual agent that executes tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Communication (Bus):</strong> The <code>IAgentParams</code> interface highlights the importance of the <code>bus</code> (a messaging system) for agents to communicate and coordinate.</li>
<li><strong>History Management:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> and <code>IAgentParams</code> emphasize the agent's ability to operate without relying on conversation history (using the <code>run</code> method).</li>
<li><strong>Tool Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>call</code> and <code>execute</code> methods are central to running tools within the agent.</li>
<li><strong>Schema &amp; Configuration:</strong> The <code>IAgentSchema</code> defines the configuration for each agent, including its tools, prompt, and completion mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interface Breakdown &amp; Key Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a summary of each interface and its role:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>IAgent</code>:</strong> The core runtime agent.  Handles independent execution, tool calls, message commitment, and lifecycle management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentParams</code>:</strong>  Provides the agent with the necessary parameters for operation, including its ID, logging, communication channel, and history management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchema</code>:</strong> Defines the configuration settings for an agent (tools, prompt, completion mechanism).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchemaCallbacks</code>:</strong>  Provides callbacks for managing different stages of an agent’s lifecycle (init, run, output, etc.).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentConnectionService</code>:</strong> A type definition for an <code>AgentConnectionService</code> – a service that manages connections between the agents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Workflow Implications</strong></p>
<p>Based on these interfaces, here’s a workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Agent Configuration:</strong> An <code>IAgentSchema</code> is created to define the agent’s settings.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Instantiation:</strong> An <code>IAgent</code> instance is created based on the schema.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>execute</code> method is called to initiate independent operation.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Calls:</strong>  The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>call</code> to execute tools.</li>
<li><strong>Message Handling:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>commitToolOutput</code>, <code>commitSystemMessage</code>, and <code>commitUserMessage</code> to manage messages.</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses the <code>bus</code> (via <code>IAgentParams</code>) to communicate with other agents.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key Concepts &amp; Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> Agents maintain their own state (conversation history, tool outputs, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Decoupling:</strong> The interfaces are designed to decouple different components of the system. This allows for flexibility and easier maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Event-Driven Architecture:</strong> The use of callbacks suggests an event-driven architecture, where components communicate through events rather than direct calls.</li>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> The interfaces highlight the importance of managing the agent's state, including conversation history, tool output, and system messages.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Integration:</strong> The <code>tools</code> property in <code>IAgentParams</code> indicates a system designed to integrate with external tools.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous Communication:</strong> Agents communicate asynchronously via a bus, allowing them to operate independently.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The system is designed to be flexible, a</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Use Cases:</strong></p>
<p>This architecture could be used for a wide range of applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chatbots:</strong>  Agents could be used to power conversational AI systems.</li>
<li><strong>Content Generation:</strong> Agents could be used to generate text, images, or other content.</li>
<li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Agents could be used to analyze data and generate insights.</li>
</ul>

You tell it which client is requesting the pipeline, what the pipeline is called, and which agent should run it.  You can also provide some data, called a payload, that the pipeline needs to work with. The function will then start the pipeline and eventually return a result, which can be any type of data depending on what the pipeline is designed to produce. Think of it as sending a job request to a team of AI agents to complete a specific task.</p>
<a id="function-scope" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function scope<a href="#function-scope" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you run a piece of code – like a task or a calculation – inside a defined environment. Think of it as setting up a little sandbox for your code to operate in.</p>
<p>You provide the code you want to run, and it will execute within this controlled space, potentially using various tools and services.</p>
<p>You can also customize which tools and services it uses by providing specific settings. If you don’t specify any customizations, it will use the standard tools already set up. This allows you to easily manage and isolate different code executions within your overall system.</p>
<a id="function-runstatelessforce" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function runStatelessForce<a href="#function-runstatelessforce" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you run a message or command through your AI agent swarm immediately, without adding it to the conversation history. Think of it as a way to quickly process one-off tasks or handle data that shouldn’s be part of the ongoing chat. It's designed to be reliable; even if the agent handling tasks has changed or isn't currently active, the command will still be executed.</p>
<p>You provide the message you want processed and a unique identifier for the client making the request. The system then handles the execution, tracks performance, and keeps things organized behind the scenes to ensure everything runs smoothly and consistently.</p>
<a id="function-runstateless" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function runStateless<a href="#function-runstateless" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you quickly send a message to a specific agent in your system without adding it to the ongoing conversation history. Think of it as a way to run a quick task or process output without cluttering the agent's memory.</p>
<p>It’s useful for situations like handling data from external sources or performing one-time jobs where maintaining a full chat log isn’t necessary. The function confirms the agent is available before running the command, and keeps track of performance details during execution.</p>
<p>You provide the message content, a unique client identifier, and the name of the agent you want to use. The agent will process the message and return a result.</p>
<a id="function-questionforce" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function questionForce<a href="#function-questionforce" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you directly trigger a question-answering process, bypassing typical chat flow. Think of it as a way to force the system to focus on a specific question and retrieve information. You provide the actual question as a <code>message</code>, a unique <code>clientId</code> to identify who’s making the request, and the <code>wikiName</code> that defines the knowledge base it should pull from. The function will then return the answer it finds.</p>
<a id="function-question" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function question<a href="#function-question" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you send a question to your AI agent swarm. It takes the actual question you want answered, a unique identifier for who's asking, the name of the specific agent you want to handle it, and the relevant knowledge source (like a wiki) it should draw from. The function will then return the agent's response to your question. Think of it as the main entry point for getting answers from your AI agents.</p>
<p>The <code>message</code> parameter holds the question itself.
<code>clientId</code> helps track requests.
<code>agentName</code> directs the question to a particular agent.
<code>wikiName</code> points to the knowledge base used for answering.</p>
<a id="function-overridewiki" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideWiki<a href="#function-overridewiki" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you change how a wiki is set up within the swarm system. Think of it as updating a wiki's blueprint – you can provide new or modified settings to adjust its behavior. This update happens independently, ensuring a fresh start for the configuration change. If logging is turned on, you'll see a record of this change in the logs. You only need to provide the parts of the wiki's setup you want to change, as it can handle partial updates.</p>
<a id="function-overridetool" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideTool<a href="#function-overridetool" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you change how a tool behaves within the agent swarm. Think of it as updating a tool’s definition – you can modify its capabilities or how it interacts with the system. It’s designed to work independently, making sure your changes don't interfere with ongoing processes. If you’re keeping a record of what’s happening, it will log that you're updating a tool. You just provide the new or updated information about the tool, and it handles the rest.</p>
<a id="function-overrideswarm" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideSwarm<a href="#function-overrideswarm" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you directly change the blueprint for a swarm, updating its settings with new information or modifications. Think of it as providing a revised plan for how the swarm operates. It makes these changes independently, ensuring a fresh start for the update process. If your system is set up to record activity, this function will also create a log entry detailing the change. You provide a partial schema – you don't need to redefine the entire swarm, just the parts you want to change.</p>
<a id="function-overridestorage" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideStorage<a href="#function-overridestorage" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you modify how the swarm system stores data. You can use it to change specific aspects of a storage configuration, like its size or access permissions. It’s designed to make these changes independently, ensuring a clear and controlled update process.  Think of it as a way to fine-tune your storage setup without affecting other ongoing operations. The system will record these changes if logging is turned on. You provide a partial description of the desired storage configuration as input.</p>

<a id="function-notifyforce" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function notifyForce<a href="#function-notifyforce" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you send a message directly out of a swarm session, like an announcement or status update, without triggering any other actions. It's specifically for sessions created using the &quot;makeConnection&quot; setup.</p>
<p>Essentially, you provide a string – that's your message – and a client ID to identify where the message is coming from.</p>
<p>Before sending, the system checks that the session and agent are still valid and active, ensuring the message gets delivered correctly. The system also makes sure the session uses &quot;makeConnection&quot; mode. It's a way to communicate with the swarm, even if things have changed since the session started.</p>
<a id="function-notify" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function notify<a href="#function-notify" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you send a message out from the AI agent swarm without triggering any further actions within the swarm itself. Think of it as a way to broadcast information – like a simple alert or status update – directly from a specific agent.</p>
<p>It’s specifically designed for sessions that were initially established using the &quot;makeConnection&quot; method. Before sending the message, the system double-checks that the agent you’re sending it from is still available and hasn’t been replaced.</p>
<p>You’re required to specify what message to send, a unique ID for the connection sending the message, and the name of the agent that should be sending the notification.</p>
<a id="function-markonline" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function markOnline<a href="#function-markonline" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you tell the system that a particular client is now active and participating in a specific group, or &quot;swarm.&quot; Think of it as signaling that a worker is ready to receive tasks. You need to provide the unique ID of the client and the name of the swarm it belongs to when you use it. It's a simple way to update the system's view of which clients are currently available.</p>
<a id="function-markoffline" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function markOffline<a href="#function-markoffline" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you tell the system that a particular client is no longer active within a specific swarm. Think of it as updating the system's knowledge about which clients are currently participating. You're essentially telling the framework, &quot;This client, identified by this ID, is offline in this swarm.&quot; It’s useful for maintaining an accurate view of your agent swarm's status and ensuring tasks are routed appropriately. You need to provide the client's unique ID and the name of the swarm it belongs to. This action doesn't return any data; it simply updates the system's internal records.</p>
<a id="function-listeneventonce" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function listenEventOnce<a href="#function-listeneventonce" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you set up a temporary listener on the swarm bus, reacting to a specific event just once. Think of it as tuning in to hear a single message on a radio station.</p>
<p>You specify which client you want to listen to (or &quot;all&quot; clients), the name of the event topic, and a filter – this filter determines which events trigger your reaction.  When an event arrives that matches your filter, a callback function executes, processing the event’s information.</p>
<p>The function handles the technical details, including ensuring your callback runs cleanly and preventing use of reserved event names.  It also provides a way to stop the listener early if needed – a function is returned that you can call to cancel the subscription.</p>
<a id="function-listenevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function listenEvent<a href="#function-listenevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you tune in to specific messages happening within the agent swarm. You tell it which client or all clients you want to hear from, and which &quot;topic&quot; – or type of message – you're interested in. When a message matching your criteria arrives, a function you provide will be run, giving you access to the message's content. To stop listening, the function returns another function that you can call to unsubscribe. It's designed to keep things orderly, ensuring messages are processed in the right sequence and preventing you from listening to reserved system topics.</p>
<a id="function-hassession" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function hasSession<a href="#function-hassession" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function helps you quickly determine if a client has an active session. It checks for a session associated with a specific client ID, essentially verifying if the client is currently connected or recognized. Behind the scenes, it relies on a session validation service to do the actual check. If your system has logging enabled, you’ll also see the function name recorded for debugging purposes. You provide the unique client identifier, and it returns a simple yes or no (true or false) answer about the session’s existence.</p>
<a id="function-hasnavigation" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function hasNavigation<a href="#function-hasnavigation" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function helps determine if an agent is involved in guiding a client through a process. It verifies the client and agent are valid, looks at the agent swarm they've joined, and then checks if the agent is on the navigation path for that client. The function keeps a record of these checks if logging is turned on in the system's settings. You provide the unique ID of the client and the name of the agent you want to check.</p>

<p>The class uses a persistence adapter, which can be customized, to handle the actual saving and loading of data.  This makes it flexible to use different storage methods, like keeping things in memory or using a database.</p>
<p>You can use it to save data for a particular client and state name, and then retrieve that data later. If the data isn't already saved, it can use a default value. The system ensures there’s only one persistence instance for each type of state, which is efficient. You can also swap out the default persistence mechanism with your own custom solution.</p>
<a id="class-persistpolicyutils" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class PersistPolicyUtils<a href="#class-persistpolicyutils" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This class provides tools for managing which clients are blocked within a swarm system. It allows you to retrieve and update lists of banned clients for a particular policy, ensuring these restrictions are saved and accessible later. The system efficiently handles persistence by creating only one storage instance per swarm. You can also customize how the policy data is stored by using a custom persistence adapter, allowing for different storage methods like in-memory solutions or databases.</p>
<a id="class-persistmemoryutils" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class PersistMemoryUtils<a href="#class-persistmemoryutils" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This class helps manage how memory is saved and retrieved for each individual client interacting with the swarm system. Think of it as a way to remember what each client was doing, so the process can be resumed later.</p>
<p>It uses a technique called memoization to make sure each client has its own dedicated memory storage, preventing unnecessary duplication and saving resources.  You can set and retrieve memory data for a client, and if no data exists, a default value can be provided.  When a client's session is over, this class also allows you to clean up the memory storage.</p>
<p>Importantly, you have the flexibility to customize how the memory is actually stored – for example, using an in-memory solution or connecting to a database – by configuring a custom memory persistence adapter.</p>

Think of it as a central registry for agent availability. It allows you to easily mark agents as online when they join the swarm, offline when they leave, and check their current status. The system remembers this information, so you don't have to constantly re-check.  You can even customize how this tracking is done if you need more than the default behavior, for example, storing the status in a database instead of in memory. This helps ensure that your swarm can operate reliably and efficiently, knowing the state of each agent.</p>

It's like a detailed performance monitoring tool.</p>
<p>It gathers information about how long client actions take, how much data is sent and received, and the overall state of those sessions. This data is then organized and can be used for reporting or analytics.</p>
<p>The service relies on several other services, injected to provide access to session information, validation data, and state computation. Think of them as helpers for retrieving the data needed to build the performance records.</p>
<p>Key functionalities include starting and stopping execution timers, calculating average response times, and generating reports on performance metrics for individual clients or the entire system. When an action happens (like a client request), the service starts a timer; when it finishes, it stops the timer and records the details. It also provides methods for clearing out old data when needed.</p>

It’s designed to efficiently manage navigation routes for each client and swarm, ensuring agents move as intended.</p>
<p>The service uses a special technique called memoization, which basically remembers previous calculations so it doesn't have to repeat them, making everything faster.  It also works with a logging system to keep a record of navigation activity and aid in debugging.</p>
<p>You can start fresh with navigation monitoring for a specific client and swarm, and also completely remove that navigation tracking when it's no longer needed. The <code>shouldNavigate</code> function is the core of the service – it checks if an agent has already been visited before allowing it to be navigated to.</p>
<a id="class-memoryschemaservice" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class MemorySchemaService<a href="#class-memoryschemaservice" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This service manages temporary, in-memory data associated with different sessions within the swarm. Think of it as a simple scratchpad for each session, allowing the system to store and retrieve data without needing to persist it anywhere.</p>
<p>It’s essentially a key-value store where the &quot;key&quot; is a session identifier and the &quot;value&quot; can be any kind of object. This allows different components, like agents or public session APIs, to share and access information relevant to a specific session.</p>
<p>The service provides simple methods to write data, read data, and completely clear out a session's data when it’s no longer needed. Importantly, this isn’t a permanent storage solution – the data disappears when the service is reset or the entry is explicitly disposed. It also logs its actions to help with debugging, under certain configuration settings.</p>

It ensures these logs are sent to both a central logging system and a client-specific one, using information about the method and overall execution to provide context.</p>
<p>It's designed to be flexible, allowing you to swap out the default logging system with a custom one if needed. The service integrates with other parts of the swarm system, such as the ClientAgent, Performance Service, and Documentation Service, to provide relevant logging during their operations.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of what it does:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Centralized and Client-Specific Logging:</strong> Sends log messages to a common logger for system-wide monitoring, and also routes messages to a client-specific logger for more targeted analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Contextual Information:</strong>  Includes details about the method and execution being performed in the logs, making it easier to understand what’s happening.</li>
<li><strong>Configurable:</strong> Logging levels (like debug or info) can be enabled or disabled through system configuration.</li>

It manages all the agents within a swarm, ensuring they work together smoothly. Think of it as a central hub that handles tasks like switching between agents, waiting for their output, and keeping track of where you are within the agent workflow.</p>
<p>It's built to be flexible and responsive, constantly updating information about agent changes and providing real-time output notifications.  It integrates with other parts of the system to handle everything from creating the swarm to executing agent tasks and managing their output.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of what it does:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manages Agents:</strong> Keeps track of all the agents in the swarm and handles switching between them.</li>
<li><strong>Waits for Output:</strong>  Provides a way to wait for an agent to finish its task and provide a result, making sure only one wait operation happens at a time.</li>
<li><strong>Navigation:</strong>  Remembers the path you’re taking through the agents, allowing you to go back and forth.</li>
<li><strong>Notifications:</strong>  Keeps everyone informed about changes in agents and their output.</li>
<li><strong>Cleanup:</strong> Provides a way to properly shut down the swarm when it's no longer needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, <code>ClientSwarm</code> simplifies working with multiple agents, ensuring they communicate effectively and their actions are coordinated.</p>
<a id="class-clientstorage" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class ClientStorage<a href="#class-clientstorage" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This class, called <code>ClientStorage</code>, is responsible for managing data storage within the swarm system, making it easily searchable using embeddings. Think of it as a central place to store and retrieve data, optimized for finding similar items.</p>
<p>When you create a <code>ClientStorage</code> instance, it handles storing, removing, and updating data.  It’s also able to quickly find items that are similar to a given search term.  The system uses a combination of internal maps for fast access and a queued dispatch system to ensure operations happen in the correct order, making it safe for multiple parts of the system to interact with the storage.</p>
<p>Key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Embedding-based Search:</strong> Finds items that are semantically similar, not just matching keywords.</li>
<li><strong>Queued Operations:</strong> Ensures storage changes happen one at a time, preventing conflicts.</li>
<li><strong>Caching:</strong> Avoids unnecessary computations by remembering previously calculated embeddings.</li>
<li><strong>Event-driven updates:</strong> Notifies other parts of the system when data changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>take</code> method is your go-to for finding similar items. <code>upsert</code>, <code>remove</code>, and <code>clear</code> handle data modification.  <code>get</code> and <code>list</code> allow you to retrieve data directly, while <code>dispose</code> cleans up the storage when it’s no longer needed.</p>
<a id="class-clientstate" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class ClientState<a href="#class-clientstate" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The ClientState class manages the data and behavior for a single agent within the swarm system. It’s like a central hub for an agent's information, handling reads and writes to that data in a controlled and organized way. Think of it as a way to make sure all changes to an agent's state happen safely and consistently, even if multiple parts of the system are trying to access it at the same time.</p>
<p>It's designed to work closely with other components, like services that handle connections and agents that use the state to make decisions. The ClientState keeps track of when the state is ready, ensures changes are written properly, and lets other parts of the system know when the data has been updated.</p>
<p>You can use it to initialize an agent’s starting data, update that data over time, and safely retrieve the latest information. It also provides a way to clean up resources when the agent is finished with its work. Essentially, ClientState makes sure each agent has a reliable and well-managed data foundation.</p>
<a id="class-clientsession" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class ClientSession<a href="#class-clientsession" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>ClientSession</code> manages interactions within a swarm of AI agents for a single client. Think of it as a dedicated workspace where the client's requests and agent responses are handled.</p>
<p>When a client sends a message, the <code>execute</code> method uses the swarm's agents to process it, checking for policy compliance and returning the result. For quick, stateless tasks, the <code>run</code> method provides a faster execution path without output validation or emission.</p>
<p>Several methods allow you to record actions within the session, like logging tool outputs (<code>commitToolOutput</code>), user messages (<code>commitUserMessage</code>), or system updates (<code>commitSystemMessage</code>). These actions are tracked within the agent's history.</p>
<p>You can connect to a message connector to receive real-time updates from the session using <code>connect</code>, and when the session is finished, the <code>dispose</code> method cleans up resources. This whole system is designed to keep track of client activity and ensure the AI agents are working within defined boundaries.</p>
<a id="class-clientpolicy" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class ClientPolicy<a href="#class-clientpolicy" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>ClientPolicy</code> class acts as a gatekeeper for your AI agent swarm, controlling access and ensuring messages are safe and compliant. It manages who can connect, filters incoming and outgoing messages, and handles banning clients who violate the rules.</p>
<p>Think of it as having a customizable security system that automatically blocks unwanted connections, checks messages for problems, and can even temporarily or permanently ban clients that misbehave.</p>
<p>This class works closely with other parts of the system. It gets its rules and initial banned client lists from configuration, enforces swarm-level restrictions defined elsewhere, validates messages before they are sent or received, and signals events to notify other components about changes like bans or unbans.  The list of banned clients isn's immediately loaded, it’s fetched only when needed for efficiency.</p>
<p>If a client tries to send a message that doesn't meet the rules, the system can automatically ban them and provide a message explaining why.  The system is also designed to easily customize how bans are handled, including how messages are generated and whether bans are persistent.</p>
<a id="class-clientoperator" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class ClientOperator<a href="#class-clientoperator" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The ClientOperator is a key component for managing interactions within the AI agent swarm. Think of it as the bridge between the user and the agents. It's responsible for sending instructions and receiving responses, essentially coordinating the flow of information.</p>

Think of it as a central place to find and use tools.</p>
<p>It remembers which tools are available for each agent, so it doesn't have to constantly check. You can ask it to list all tools for a particular agent, or check if a specific tool exists.</p>
<p>If the list of tools changes, you can refresh it for a single agent or for all agents. When you want an agent to use a tool, you use this component to actually run the tool with the right instructions.</p>
<p>Finally, when an agent is finished, you can tell the component to clean up resources associated with that agent, removing any cached tools.</p>
<a id="class-clienthistory" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class ClientHistory<a href="#class-clienthistory" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The ClientHistory class manages an agent's conversation history within the swarm system. It stores, retrieves, and filters messages, and keeps everything in sync with other parts of the system through events.</p>
<p>When a new message arrives, the <code>push</code> method adds it to the history and signals this change to other components. The <code>pop</code> method retrieves and removes the most recent message, useful for actions like undoing steps.</p>
<p>To get a complete, unfiltered view of the history, you can use <code>toArrayForRaw</code>. For generating completions for an agent, <code>toArrayForAgent</code> is used. This method carefully filters and formats the messages, taking into account agent-specific rules and configuration.</p>
<p>Finally, <code>dispose</code> cleans up resources when the agent is no longer needed, ensuring efficient memory usage.</p>
<a id="class-clientcompute" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class ClientCompute<a href="#class-clientcompute" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>ClientCompute</code> class is designed to handle the interactions and computations needed by an AI agent swarm. It’s essentially a way to manage and execute tasks within the swarm’s computational environment.</p>
<p>When you create a <code>ClientCompute</code> instance, you provide initial setup information through parameters. It holds these parameters for later use.</p>
<p>The <code>getComputeData</code> method fetches data related to the computation, allowing you to retrieve necessary information for processing.</p>
<p>The <code>calculate</code> method is the workhorse – it performs the core computations for a specific state within the swarm.</p>
<p>The <code>update</code> method allows you to refresh the computation's status or data.</p>
<p>Finally, <code>dispose</code> is used to clean up resources when the computation is no longer needed, ensuring proper resource management.</p>
<a id="class-clientagent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Class ClientAgent<a href="#class-clientagent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>ClientAgent</code> manages how an agent within a larger system receives and processes messages, and coordinates interactions with tools and other services. It's responsible for running messages, executing tools, and keeping track of the agent's history, all while preventing overlaps in operations.</p>
<p>Think of it as the core engine that handles incoming instructions, figures out what tools to use, manages errors, and makes sure everything is logged and communicated correctly within the overall system.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of what it does:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Handles Messages:</strong>  It receives instructions (&quot;messages&quot;) and decides what to do with them, including running tools or generating responses.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Management:</strong> It figures out which tools are available, resolves any conflicts, and executes them as needed. It can also stop tool execution if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Error Recovery:</strong> If things go wrong (like a tool failing), it has strategies to try and recover, like re-trying or generating a placeholder response.</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> It communicates changes and outputs to other parts of the system, like logging interactions and broadcasting results.</li>
<li><strong>State Tracking:</strong>  It meticulously keeps track of everything that happens – messages, tools, errors – ensuring a complete record of the agent’s activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>ClientAgent</code> has several components that make these actions possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>_toolAbortController</code></strong>: Manages the lifecycle of tool executions.</li>
<li><strong><code>_agentChangeSubject</code></strong>: Signals changes to the agent's state, allowing for controlled interruptions.</li>
<li><strong><code>_resqueSubject</code></strong>:  Indicates a model resurrection event, used for error recovery.</li>
<li><strong><code>_toolErrorSubject</code></strong>:  Reports errors during tool execution.</li>
<li><strong><code>_toolStopSubject</code></strong>:  Signals a halt to tool execution.</li>
<li><strong><code>_toolCommitSubject</code></strong>: Indicates tool output commitments.</li>
<li><strong><code>_outputSubject</code></strong>:  Emits transformed outputs.</li>

Each pipeline has a unique <code>pipelineName</code> to identify it.</p>
<p>The <code>execute</code> function is the core of the pipeline; it's how you trigger the pipeline’s workflow, specifying a client ID, the agent to start with, and any necessary data in the <code>payload</code>. The function returns a promise that resolves either with the result of the pipeline or nothing if no result is expected.</p>
<p>Finally, <code>callbacks</code> allow you to hook into different stages of the pipeline's execution. You can specify functions to be called at specific points, giving you more control and visibility into what’s happening.</p>

Think of them as notification hooks – you provide these functions, and the framework calls them at specific points in the pipeline's lifecycle.</p>
<p>You’re given an <code>onStart</code> function to know when a pipeline begins, providing the client ID, pipeline name, and any initial data.  The <code>onEnd</code> function lets you track when a pipeline completes, including whether it finished successfully or encountered an error, again with details like client ID, pipeline name, and final data.  Finally, <code>onError</code> is triggered if anything goes wrong during the pipeline execution, giving you the client ID, pipeline name, payload, and the error object itself, so you can handle issues gracefully.  By implementing these callbacks, you gain visibility into what your AI agent swarm is doing and can react to events in real time.</p>

<a id="interface-icompletioncallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface ICompletionCallbacks<a href="#interface-icompletioncallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you tap into what happens after an AI agent completes a task. Think of it as a way to be notified and react when a job is finished. You can use the <code>onComplete</code> function to do things like record the results, process the output further, or even start another process based on the completion. It’s a handy way to extend the framework’s functionality and customize its behavior.</p>
<a id="interface-icompletionargs" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface ICompletionArgs<a href="#interface-icompletionargs" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the information needed to ask the AI agent swarm to generate a response. Think of it as a package containing all the relevant details for a single request.</p>
<p>It includes a client identifier to track where the request came from, the name of the agent handling it, and the conversation history – essentially what's already been said.</p>
<p>You can also provide a list of available tools the agent might use to answer the request, and specify whether the last message came from a tool or a user. This helps the agent understand the context and generate a more relevant and helpful response.</p>
<a id="interface-icompletion" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface ICompletion<a href="#interface-icompletion" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how your AI agents can suggest and finalize actions. Think of it as a way to guide the agents through a process, offering options and ensuring they reach a desired outcome. It provides a full set of tools for generating responses from AI models, giving you control over the agent's actions.</p>
<a id="interface-iclientperfomancerecord" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IClientPerfomanceRecord<a href="#interface-iclientperfomancerecord" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface, <code>IClientPerformanceRecord</code>, helps track how individual clients – like user sessions or agent instances – are performing within your system. Think of it as a detailed report card for each client.</p>
<p>It breaks down key metrics like the number of times a client executed a task, the amount of data it processed (both input and output), and how long those executions took.  You’re able to see the raw data for memory and state used by each client, providing insight into resource usage.</p>
<p>The <code>clientId</code> property ensures you can easily link the performance data back to a specific client's session or agent.  By collecting this data, you gain a much clearer picture of what’s impacting overall system performance and can identify areas for optimization on a per-client basis.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatinstancecallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatInstanceCallbacks<a href="#interface-ichatinstancecallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines a set of callbacks that allow you to listen for and react to key events happening within a chat instance managed by the AI agent swarm orchestration framework.</p>
<p>You can use these callbacks to monitor the lifecycle of an instance, from its initial setup (<code>onInit</code>) to when it's finished (<code>onDispose</code>).</p>
<p>You'll also receive notifications when a chat session starts (<code>onBeginChat</code>), a message is sent (<code>onSendMessage</code>), or when the system is checking activity status (<code>onCheckActivity</code>). These notifications provide valuable information about what's happening within the swarm and let you build custom logic to respond to specific events.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatinstance" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatInstance<a href="#interface-ichatinstance" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface, <code>IChatInstance</code>, provides the core functionality for interacting with an individual AI chat session within your agent swarm. Think of it as a single window into a conversation with an AI agent.</p>
<p>You start a chat with <code>beginChat</code>, then send messages to the agent using <code>sendMessage</code> to get responses. <code>checkLastActivity</code> lets you monitor how recently the chat has been active, useful for managing resources. When you're done, <code>dispose</code> cleans up the chat session properly. Finally, <code>listenDispose</code> allows you to be notified when a chat session is being closed.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatcontrol" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatControl<a href="#interface-ichatcontrol" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface, IChatControl, lets you configure how your AI agent swarm interacts with chat systems. You can tell the framework which specific chat implementation to use by setting the chat instance constructor.  It also allows you to provide custom functions to be called at various points during the chat process, enabling you to respond to events or modify behavior. Think of it as a way to personalize and integrate your AI agents with different chat platforms and tailor their reactions.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatargs" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatArgs<a href="#interface-ichatargs" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface, IChatArgs, defines the information needed to interact with an AI agent during a conversation. Each time you want an agent to process a message, you'll provide a set of arguments that includes a unique client identifier to track the conversation, the name of the agent currently responsible for the chat, and, of course, the actual message content. Think of it as the basic ingredients for a single turn in an AI agent's conversation.</p>
<a id="interface-ibuseventcontext" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBusEventContext<a href="#interface-ibuseventcontext" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface provides extra details about events happening within the swarm system. Think of it as a way to tag events with information about which agent, swarm, storage, state, compute or policy is involved. When an agent sends an event, it usually only includes its own name. But for broader system events, like those managed by a swarm itself, you might find more of these details added to provide a clearer picture of what’s happening.</p>
<a id="interface-ibusevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBusEvent<a href="#interface-ibusevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface describes a standardized event used within the system to communicate between different components, particularly from ClientAgents. Think of it as a way for agents to tell the rest of the swarm what's happening – whether they’s starting a task, sending a message, or reporting a result.</p>
<p>Each event has a source, which indicates where it originated (usually &quot;agent-bus&quot; from ClientAgents). It also has a type, which specifies the kind of action being performed (like &quot;run&quot; or &quot;commit-user-message&quot;).  Crucially, the event carries both input data, which might be needed to perform the action, and output data, which holds the results of that action.  Finally, contextual information like the agent's name is included to provide more details about the event.</p>
<a id="interface-ibus" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBus<a href="#interface-ibus" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>IBus</code> interface acts like a central communication hub for the agent swarm system. It lets different parts of the system, especially agents, send updates and information to specific clients in a reliable and organized way.</p>
<p>The main function, <code>emit</code>, is how agents broadcast these updates. It sends structured events to a designated client, letting them know about things like message commits, tool executions, or the completion of a task. Every event follows a standard format, including details about the event type, origin, input and output data, and the intended recipient.</p>
<p>Using <code>emit</code> helps keep different parts of the system working together smoothly, as it allows them to communicate without being directly connected. Events are sent asynchronously and include a client ID for precise targeting. Examples include signaling the completion of a task with a result or broadcasting a validated output. The <code>clientId</code> is repeated within the event itself, providing an extra layer of clarity.</p>
<a id="interface-ibaseevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBaseEvent<a href="#interface-ibaseevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface outlines the fundamental structure for all events within the AI agent swarm. Every event generated by the system, whether it's a standard communication or a custom notification, will adhere to this base structure.</p>
<p>Each event needs a <code>source</code> property, which indicates where it came from – for example, an agent or a specific component. It also requires a <code>clientId</code> property, ensuring the event is delivered to the correct client or agent instance within the swarm. Think of <code>clientId</code> as a way to pinpoint the recipient of the event.</p>
<a id="interface-iagenttoolcallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentToolCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagenttoolcallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you hook into the lifecycle of an agent tool, giving you control over what happens before, after, and during its operation. You can use the <code>onBeforeCall</code> callback to perform tasks like logging or preparing data right before a tool runs. The <code>onAfterCall</code> callback allows you to handle cleanup or post-processing activities once the tool has finished.  Need to ensure the tool's input is correct? The <code>onValidate</code> callback lets you implement custom validation logic to check the parameters. Finally, if something goes wrong during tool execution, the <code>onCallError</code> callback provides a way to log the error or attempt recovery actions.</p>
<a id="interface-iagenttool" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentTool<a href="#interface-iagenttool" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface describes a tool that an AI agent can use within a larger group, or swarm. Each tool has a unique name for easy identification and can optionally include a description to help users understand how to use it.</p>
<p>Before a tool runs, it can perform validation to make sure the input data is correct.  This validation step can be quick or more complex, potentially taking some time to complete.</p>
<p>You can also add optional &quot;lifecycle callbacks&quot; to your tool. These callbacks let you customize what happens before or after the tool actually runs, allowing for more control over the process.</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>call</code> method is how the tool actually gets executed, and it receives all the necessary information about the request, including any previous tool calls and a way to signal if the process should be stopped.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemacallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagentschemacallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you hook into different moments in an agent's lifecycle, allowing your system to react to what's happening. You can listen for when an agent starts running, produces output, uses a tool, or receives messages – both from the assistant and from users. There are also callbacks for less common events, like when an agent is reset, paused, or completely shut down, and when its history is cleared. This enables you to build custom monitoring, logging, or even interactive features around your agents. You can also be notified about tool requests before they're executed and receive updates after the tools have finished their tasks.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschema" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchema<a href="#interface-iagentschema" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how each agent within your AI swarm is configured. Think of it as a blueprint for creating agents.</p>
<p>You can give your agents a unique name, and define a primary prompt to guide their behavior. They also have a system prompt, which helps them understand how to use tools.</p>
<p>To control how agents interact, you can limit the number of tools they use or the number of messages they remember. You can also provide descriptions to help people understand how to use each agent.</p>
<p>If an agent needs to interact with a human operator, there's a specific function to handle that connection.  You can also specify which tools and storage systems the agent can access, and even define dependencies on other agents.</p>
<p>Finally, you can customize the agent's lifecycle with various callbacks, like validating its output or transforming its responses before they're used. It allows you to fine-tune how each agent operates within the swarm.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentparams" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentParams<a href="#interface-iagentparams" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the information needed to run an agent within the system. Think of it as a configuration package, providing the agent with its identity (clientId), ways to log activity (logger), a communication channel (bus), access to external tools (mcp), a memory for past interactions (history), a way to generate responses (completion), and a list of tools it can use (tools). There's also a validation step (validate) to check the agent's output before it's considered complete.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentnavigationparams" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentNavigationParams<a href="#interface-iagentnavigationparams" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how you can tell the system to move an agent to a specific location or tool. Think of it as providing instructions: you specify the name of the tool you want the agent to use, a short explanation of what it does, and which agent it should move to. There’s also a place for extra notes to help explain the tool’s purpose, and a way to tell the system to ignore certain outputs when multiple navigation options exist. Essentially, it's a way to guide the agents to where they need to be and what they need to do.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentconnectionservice" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentConnectionService<a href="#interface-iagentconnectionservice" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface helps us define how agents connect and communicate within the system. Think of it as a blueprint for making sure the public-facing parts of agent connections are consistent and reliable. It's designed to strip away the internal workings, leaving only the essential methods and properties that external components need to interact with. This keeps things clean and predictable for anyone working with agent connections.</p>
<a id="interface-iagent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgent<a href="#interface-iagent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>IAgent</code> interface defines how you interact with individual agents within the swarm orchestration framework. It outlines the core actions you can perform, like running the agent for a quick test without affecting its memory, or executing it to process input and potentially update its history. You can also use methods to manually add messages—system instructions, user prompts, tool outputs, or assistant responses—to the agent's ongoing conversation.  There are also controls to manage tool usage, clear the agent’s memory, and halt tool execution if needed. This interface provides a way to precisely control and monitor each agent’s behavior and interaction.</p>
