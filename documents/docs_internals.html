<p><strong>Overall Architecture:</strong></p>
<p>This system built around a distributed, asynchronous architecture. Agents communicate via a message queue, and their interactions are orchestrated through a series of tools and processes. The core concept is to allow agents to perform tasks independently while still being part of a larger, coordinated system.</p>
<p><strong>Core Concepts &amp; Relationships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swarm Orchestration:</strong> The entire framework is built around orchestrating agents to perform tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Agent as the Central Unit:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> is the fundamental building block – the individual agent that executes tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Communication (Bus):</strong> The <code>IAgentParams</code> interface highlights the importance of the <code>bus</code> (a messaging system) for agents to communicate and coordinate.</li>
<li><strong>History Management:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> and <code>IAgentParams</code> emphasize the agent's ability to operate without relying on conversation history (using the <code>run</code> method).</li>
<li><strong>Tool Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>call</code> and <code>execute</code> methods are central to running tools within the agent.</li>
<li><strong>Schema &amp; Configuration:</strong> The <code>IAgentSchema</code> defines the configuration for each agent, including its tools, prompt, and completion mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interface Breakdown &amp; Key Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a summary of each interface and its role:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>IAgent</code>:</strong> The core runtime agent.  Handles independent execution, tool calls, message commitment, and lifecycle management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentParams</code>:</strong>  Provides the agent with the necessary parameters for operation, including its ID, logging, communication channel, and history management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchema</code>:</strong> Defines the configuration settings for an agent (tools, prompt, completion mechanism).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchemaCallbacks</code>:</strong>  Provides callbacks for managing different stages of an agent’s lifecycle (init, run, output, etc.).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentConnectionService</code>:</strong> A type definition for an <code>AgentConnectionService</code> – a service that manages connections between the agents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Workflow Implications</strong></p>
<p>Based on these interfaces, here’s a workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Agent Configuration:</strong> An <code>IAgentSchema</code> is created to define the agent’s settings.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Instantiation:</strong> An <code>IAgent</code> instance is created based on the schema.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>execute</code> method is called to initiate independent operation.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Calls:</strong>  The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>call</code> to execute tools.</li>
<li><strong>Message Handling:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>commitToolOutput</code>, <code>commitSystemMessage</code>, and <code>commitUserMessage</code> to manage messages.</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses the <code>bus</code> (via <code>IAgentParams</code>) to communicate with other agents.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key Concepts &amp; Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> Agents maintain their own state (conversation history, tool outputs, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Decoupling:</strong> The interfaces are designed to decouple different components of the system. This allows for flexibility and easier maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Event-Driven Architecture:</strong> The use of callbacks suggests an event-driven architecture, where components communicate through events rather than direct calls.</li>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> The interfaces highlight the importance of managing the agent's state, including conversation history, tool output, and system messages.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Integration:</strong> The <code>tools</code> property in <code>IAgentParams</code> indicates a system designed to integrate with external tools.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous Communication:</strong> Agents communicate asynchronously via a bus, allowing them to operate independently.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The system is designed to be flexible, a</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Use Cases:</strong></p>
<p>This architecture could be used for a wide range of applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chatbots:</strong>  Agents could be used to power conversational AI systems.</li>
<li><strong>Content Generation:</strong> Agents could be used to generate text, images, or other content.</li>
<li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Agents could be used to analyze data and generate insights.</li>

Think of it as the brain of a single agent, processing instructions and interacting with the outside world.</p>
<p>It takes care of a lot under the hood, like managing tool calls, keeping track of history, and handling errors gracefully – if something goes wrong, it can even attempt to recover. The agent uses subjects to manage its internal state, ensuring that changes and errors are handled asynchronously.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of what it does:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Receives and Executes Instructions:</strong>  It takes text input and either runs a quick, stateless completion or executes a more complex process involving tools. It makes sure only one process runs at a time.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Management:</strong> It resolves available tools, ensuring no duplicates, and controls their lifecycle. It can also stop tools if needed.</li>
<li><strong>Error Handling &amp; Recovery:</strong>  If something fails, it tries to recover, potentially retrying the process.</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong>  It broadcasts updates and outputs to the wider swarm system and keeps a record of its activity.</li>
<li><strong>Cleanup:</strong> When finished, it cleans up resources properly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, the <code>ClientAgent</code> is a robust and well-managed system for orchestrating the behavior of an AI agent within a larger swarm.</p>

You can use these functions to fetch the initial messages for an agent, determine which messages are important enough to keep, and react to changes in the history – whether a new message is added, an old one is removed, or the entire history is being processed. It also provides opportunities to be notified when the history is set up, taken down, or when its contents are being read. Finally, you’re given direct access to the history instance itself, allowing for deeper integration and control.</p>

Think of it as a way to keep track of what each agent has said and done.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>iterate</code> method to review the messages associated with a specific agent, essentially stepping through their past interactions.</p>
<p><code>waitForInit</code> makes sure the history is ready for an agent, potentially loading any necessary starting data.</p>
<p>When an agent produces a new message, the <code>push</code> method adds it to their history.</p>
<p>If you need to retrieve the last message an agent generated, <code>pop</code> removes and returns it.</p>
<p>Finally, <code>dispose</code> cleans up the history for an agent, freeing up resources and optionally deleting all stored data.</p>

Think of it as a way to store and retrieve messages exchanged between agents and clients.</p>
<p>You can add new messages to the history using the <code>push</code> method, specifying the message content, client ID, and agent name.  The <code>pop</code> method allows you to retrieve and remove the most recent message. To clean up the history for a specific client and agent, use the <code>dispose</code> method. Finally, the <code>iterate</code> method provides a way to loop through all the historical messages for a particular client and agent.</p>

It's like a memory log for each agent, recording every message sent and received.</p>
<p>You can add new messages to this history using the <code>push</code> method. To retrieve older messages, you can use <code>pop</code> to get the very last one that was recorded.</p>
<p>If you need to prepare the history to be sent to a specific agent, <code>toArrayForAgent</code> takes a prompt and optional system instructions to create a tailored message sequence. Conversely, <code>toArrayForRaw</code> lets you retrieve all the messages in their original, unfiltered form.</p>

Think of it as the system's control panel, allowing you to tweak how agents interact, handle errors, log events, and manage data storage.</p>
<p>It's broken down into categories like tool call handling (what to do when tools fail), logging (how much detail to show), agent behavior (like how agents choose their actions), and storage management (how data is saved and retrieved).</p>
<p>You can change these settings to customize the swarm to your specific needs—for example, you might want to change how the system responds to tool call errors or adjust the level of detail in its logs. Many of the functions within this file offer default behaviors, but they can be overridden to implement custom logic for specific use cases.  It influences everything from error recovery (&quot;flush&quot; vs. &quot;recomplete&quot; strategies) to logging verbosity and even how agents navigate different states.  Changes here affect agents' operations, logging, error handling, and data persistence.</p>

Think of it as providing a set of instructions for the system when it needs to do special things.</p>
<p>You can define custom messages to be sent when the system needs to clear its memory (flushMessage), when an agent generates tool output (toolOutput), when a message is sent to the agent (emitMessage), or when an action needs to be executed (executeMessage).</p>
<p>Each of these properties can be a simple text message, or a function that dynamically generates a message based on details like the client ID, the agent's name, or the last message from the user, allowing for flexible and context-aware communication.</p>

It provides settings to define specific messages or even functions that will be used when the agent needs to clear its memory (flush), start a new task (execute), or receive results from a tool. You can use simple text messages, or create dynamic messages by providing functions that take information like the client ID and the agent’s name as input. These functions allow for very flexible and tailored communication with the agent swarm.</p>

Think of it as the common blueprint – every piece of information the swarm keeps track of inherits from it. Specific types of data, like agent health or system state, build upon this base to provide more detailed information.</p>
<a id="interface-iembeddingschema" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IEmbeddingSchema<a href="#interface-iembeddingschema" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you configure how your AI agents understand and compare information within the swarm.</p>
<p>You can choose to save agent states and navigation history for later use. Every embedding mechanism needs a unique name so the system knows which one it's using.</p>
<p>The <code>writeEmbeddingCache</code> function is used to store computed embeddings – essentially saving the results of processing text so you don't have to do it again. Conversely, <code>readEmbeddingCache</code> lets you quickly check if an embedding has already been calculated and stored.</p>
<p>You also have the option to customize embedding-related actions with callback functions. To create embeddings from text, you'll use the <code>createEmbedding</code> method, and to measure how similar two embeddings are, you can call <code>calculateSimilarity</code>.</p>

It builds upon a standard event structure, but gives you the freedom to include any type of information you need within the event’s payload. Think of it as a way to send specialized messages beyond the standard event formats, perfect for situations where you need to share specific details about something happening. You can use this to broadcast events with data like completion status or other details that don’t fit into the predefined event schemas.</p>
<a id="interface-iconfig" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IConfig<a href="#interface-iconfig" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the configuration options for generating a UML diagram, specifically concerning whether to include subtrees in the visualization. The <code>withSubtree</code> property, when set to <code>true</code>, instructs the system to expand and display all nested components and relationships within the agent swarm's structure. Setting it to <code>false</code> will create a more simplified, top-level view of the orchestration. This allows you to control the level of detail in the generated UML representation based on your needs.</p>

Think of it as a blueprint for how an agent should perform a specific piece of work.</p>
<p>It includes a descriptive text (<code>docDescription</code>) to explain what the task does, and a flag (<code>shared</code>) indicating whether it's a commonly used task. Each task has a unique name (<code>computeName</code>) and a time-to-live (<code>ttl</code>) specifying how long its data should be stored.</p>
<p>The <code>getComputeData</code> function is crucial – it’s how the framework retrieves the data needed for the computation. The task can also rely on other tasks (<code>dependsOn</code>), ensuring they run in the correct order.</p>
<p>You can add custom logic around the task execution using <code>middlewares</code>, and provide specific function calls to be executed after the computation completes with <code>callbacks</code>.</p>

Think of these middleware as translators or helpers, allowing you to customize how tasks are passed to and results received from your AI agents. They can modify the prompts sent to the agents, handle agent responses in a specific way, or even perform calculations based on the agent output. Implementing this interface lets you inject custom logic into the agent execution pipeline, like adding logging, validating data, or transforming the information exchanged. It’s a flexible way to tailor the framework to your specific AI agent setup and requirements.</p>

Think of it as a standardized way for your agents to request and use processing power or data without needing to know the specifics of how that resource works.  It defines methods for establishing a connection, sending commands, receiving results, and safely closing that connection. Developers implementing this interface provide the actual mechanics of how agents communicate with those compute resources, ensuring consistent operation within the swarm. This abstraction makes it easier to swap out different compute resources without modifying the core agent logic.</p>

Think of these callbacks as hooks that let you tap into what’s happening.</p>
<p><code>onInit</code> gets called when a compute unit is being initialized, providing its unique identifier (clientId) and the name of the compute it represents.</p>
<p><code>onDispose</code> signals that a compute unit is being shut down, again with its clientId and computeName.</p>
<p><code>onCompute</code> allows you to receive data being processed by a compute unit, along with identifying information.</p>
<p><code>onCalculate</code> provides a notification whenever a calculation is performed by a compute unit, including the state name involved.</p>
<p>Finally, <code>onUpdate</code> alerts you when a compute unit's status is updated, letting you know something has changed.</p>

Each completion mechanism has a unique name, allowing the swarm to identify and manage it. You can also customize what happens after a completion is generated by providing optional callback functions. The core functionality is <code>getCompletion</code>, a method that takes input and produces a model's response – essentially, it's how the swarm gets those helpful suggestions.</p>
<a id="interface-icompletioncallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface ICompletionCallbacks<a href="#interface-icompletioncallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you define what happens <em>after</em> an AI agent successfully finishes a task. Think of it as a way to be notified when something's done, so you can do something else – maybe log the result, process it further, or kick off another action. You can use the <code>onComplete</code> property to specify a function that will be called with details about the completed task and the AI's output.</p>

Think of it as a package containing everything the agents need to understand the request – who's asking, which agent is making the request, what kind of interaction it is (user or tool), the conversation history so far, and a list of any available tools the agents can use. Each request needs a unique client ID and agent name to keep track of things. The <code>messages</code> array holds the conversation history, allowing the agents to maintain context. Finally, if the agent needs to use any external tools, those are listed in the <code>tools</code> array.</p>
<a id="interface-icompletion" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface ICompletion<a href="#interface-icompletion" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how your AI agents can receive responses from language models. Think of it as the standard way agents get their answers – it outlines the structure of that answer. It builds upon a basic completion format, providing a full set of tools for actually generating and handling those model replies, ensuring consistent and predictable communication within your agent swarm.</p>

It's designed to give you a detailed view of how each client is performing.</p>
<p>Each client record includes a unique identifier (<code>clientId</code>) and tracks various aspects of their activity. You're seeing records of their session memory (<code>sessionMemory</code>) and persistent state (<code>sessionState</code>), offering insights into what data they're using and their current status.</p>
<p>The record also monitors how many times the client executes commands (<code>executionCount</code>), the total size of the data they process for input and output (<code>executionInputTotal</code>, <code>executionOutputTotal</code>), and average sizes per execution. Finally, it captures the total and average execution times (<code>executionTimeTotal</code>, <code>executionTimeAverage</code>), providing a clear picture of the client's overall performance and latency.

Think of these callbacks as notifications – your code will be informed about key events happening within a particular chat session.  You'll receive updates when a chat instance is first created, when it's finished, and when messages are sent.  The <code>onCheckActivity</code> callback lets you monitor the activity status of the chat instance. These callbacks help you build custom logic around chat interactions within your swarm.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatinstance" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatInstance<a href="#interface-ichatinstance" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface represents a single chat session within your agent swarm. Think of it as a container for one ongoing conversation.</p>
<p>You use <code>beginChat</code> to start a new conversation.  <code>sendMessage</code> is how you send messages to the chat, and it returns the response. To keep the chat alive, <code>checkLastActivity</code> lets you verify if there's been recent interaction within a set time limit. When you’re finished with a chat, <code>dispose</code> cleans everything up. Finally, <code>listenDispose</code> allows you to be notified when a chat session ends, so you can perform any necessary cleanup or tracking.</p>

The <code>useChatAdapter</code> function lets you specify the blueprint for creating those chat instances, giving you control over the underlying technology.  You can also customize the behavior of your chat sessions by defining specific actions that trigger on certain events; <code>useChatCallbacks</code> lets you set up these reaction points for things like receiving messages or completing a conversation. Basically, it’s about tailoring the chat experience to fit your specific needs and agent setup.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatargs" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatArgs<a href="#interface-ichatargs" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface, <code>IChatArgs</code>, defines the data needed to pass information about a chat interaction. Think of it as a standard format for sending messages between your application and the AI agent swarm. Each chat needs a <code>clientId</code> to identify where it originated, a specific <code>agentName</code> indicating which agent is responsible for the conversation, and, of course, the <code>message</code> content itself. It’s a simple way to structure chat data for reliable communication.</p>
<a id="interface-ibuseventcontext" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBusEventContext<a href="#interface-ibuseventcontext" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface describes extra information that can be included with events happening within the AI agent swarm. Think of it as a way to add details about which agent, swarm, storage, state, compute, or policy is involved in a particular event.</p>
<p>For agents directly interacting with the system, only the agent's name is usually included. Other fields are primarily for system-wide events related to swarms, storage, states, compute resources, or policies. It helps to track and understand the context of these events within the larger system.</p>
<a id="interface-ibusevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBusEvent<a href="#interface-ibusevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface describes the structure of messages sent across the system’s internal communication channels, primarily used by agents to notify the core system about actions and data. Each message has a clearly defined origin (&quot;source&quot;), a descriptive &quot;type&quot; indicating its purpose (like &quot;run&quot; or &quot;commit-user-message&quot;), and can carry both input data (&quot;input&quot;) and results (&quot;output&quot;). It also includes context information (&quot;context&quot;), such as the agent's name, to provide additional details about the event’s origin and relevant circumstances. This standardized format ensures that different parts of the system can understand and react to events generated by agents.</p>
<a id="interface-ibus" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBus<a href="#interface-ibus" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>IBus</code> interface acts as a central communication channel within the swarm system, allowing different parts of the system to talk to each other without needing to know the specifics of how the other parts work. Think of it like a public announcement system – agents use it to broadcast updates and information to specific clients.</p>
<p>You’re most likely to see this used by agents when they need to notify clients about things like messages being committed, tools being executed, or the results of a task.  The <code>emit</code> method is how agents send these notifications; you provide a client ID to ensure the message goes to the right place and the event data follows a defined structure.</p>
<p>This system helps keep things organized and responsive, ensuring everyone stays informed about what’s happening in the swarm.  The events are structured, using a consistent format including details like the event type, source, and client ID, and the process is asynchronous – it doesn't block the agent's work while it sends the notification. The <code>clientId</code> included in the event itself is a bit redundant as it’s tied to the target of the <code>emit</code> method, acting as a safeguard.</p>

Every event, like an agent sending a message or a session updating, will have this basic structure.</p>
<p>Think of it as a standardized envelope: each event needs to specify where it came from (the <code>source</code>) and who it’s intended for (<code>clientId</code>). This ensures that messages are routed correctly within the system, so the right agents or sessions receive them. It's a core building block for event-driven interactions within the swarm.</p>
<a id="interface-iagenttoolcallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentToolCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagenttoolcallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how you can hook into the lifecycle of an agent tool, letting you customize what happens before, during, and after it runs.</p>
<p>You can use <code>onBeforeCall</code> to perform actions like logging or setting up resources just before a tool executes.  <code>onAfterCall</code> lets you clean up, log results, or do post-processing steps once the tool finishes.</p>
<p><code>onValidate</code> provides a way to check if the tool's parameters are correct before it even starts, ensuring things run smoothly.  Finally, <code>onCallError</code> helps you handle and log any errors that occur during the tool's execution.</p>
<a id="interface-iagenttool" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentTool<a href="#interface-iagenttool" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface describes what a tool looks like within the agent swarm system. Each tool needs a name to be recognized and a <code>validate</code> function to check if the provided input is correct before it runs.</p>
<p>You can also provide a short description (<code>docNote</code>) to help users understand how to use the tool.</p>
<p>The <code>call</code> function is how the tool gets executed, taking parameters and information about the request. Finally, you can add optional lifecycle hooks (<code>callbacks</code>) to customize how the tool behaves at different stages of its operation.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemacallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagentschemacallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you hook into different points in an agent's lifecycle. You can define functions to be called when an agent starts running, produces output, uses a tool, generates system or assistant messages, or when its history is cleared. It also provides callbacks for agent initialization, disposal, and resurrection after interruptions, allowing you to monitor and react to the agent's behavior at various stages.  You can even get notified after a series of tool calls finish. These callbacks give you a way to observe and potentially influence the agent’s operations without directly modifying its core logic.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschema" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchema<a href="#interface-iagentschema" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how an AI agent is configured within a swarm. Think of it as a blueprint for each agent, specifying its purpose, capabilities, and how it interacts with the system.</p>
<p>Each agent has a unique name and a primary prompt that guides its behavior. It can also be given a description for documentation. An agent might be designated as an &quot;operator,&quot; which affects its operational flow.</p>
<p>Agents are equipped with tools and can access specific storage and wiki resources. They can be set up to depend on other agents for transitions.</p>
<p>To customize agent behavior, you can define functions like <code>mapToolCalls</code> to filter tool calls, <code>validate</code> to check outputs, and <code>transform</code> to modify model responses. You can also specify dynamic system prompts that change based on context.</p>
<p>Lifecycle events can be customized with optional callbacks, allowing for fine-grained control over the agent’s execution.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentparams" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentParams<a href="#interface-iagentparams" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the settings and components given to an agent when it's running. Think of it as a package of information that tells the agent who it's working for (clientId), how to log its actions (logger), how to communicate with other agents (bus), how to use external tools (mcp), how to keep track of what it's done (history), how to create final results (completion), and what tools are at its disposal (tools). There’s also a function included to double-check the agent’s output before it’s considered finished (validate).</p>
<a id="interface-iagentnavigationparams" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentNavigationParams<a href="#interface-iagentnavigationparams" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you define how an agent should move around and interact within a larger system. Think of it as a set of instructions to guide an agent’s actions. You specify the name and a brief explanation of the tool the agent will use, as well as the destination agent it should be directed towards.  There's also a place to add extra notes for documentation, and a way to tell the system to ignore certain outputs if multiple navigation options are available.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentconnectionservice" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentConnectionService<a href="#interface-iagentconnectionservice" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface helps us define how agents connect and communicate within the system. Think of it as a blueprint for creating services that manage these connections, but it's designed to hide some of the technical details that aren't relevant to the outside world. It ensures that the publicly accessible parts of agent connection services are consistent and predictable.</p>
<a id="interface-iagent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgent<a href="#interface-iagent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface describes how you interact with an individual agent within the system. Think of it as the blueprint for an agent's actions and how it responds to instructions.</p>
<p>The <code>run</code> method lets you test an agent's capabilities without altering its memory or previous interactions – it’s like a quick, isolated test.  <code>execute</code> is the main way to get the agent working, sending it input and potentially updating its memory depending on the chosen mode.  <code>waitForOutput</code> simply waits for the agent to finish its current task and retrieve the result.</p>
<p>You can also manually influence the agent's memory and process by adding messages with <code>commitToolOutput</code>, <code>commitSystemMessage</code>, <code>commitUserMessage</code>, and <code>commitAssistantMessage</code>. These methods allow you to add information without immediately prompting a new response from the agent.  If you need to start fresh, <code>commitFlush</code> resets the agent’s memory completely.  Finally, <code>commitStopTools</code> can be used to halt the agent’s ongoing tasks, while <code>commitAgentChange</code> puts a pause on the agent’s execution flow.</p>
