<p><strong>Overall Architecture:</strong></p>
<p>This system built around a distributed, asynchronous architecture. Agents communicate via a message queue, and their interactions are orchestrated through a series of tools and processes. The core concept is to allow agents to perform tasks independently while still being part of a larger, coordinated system.</p>
<p><strong>Core Concepts &amp; Relationships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swarm Orchestration:</strong> The entire framework is built around orchestrating agents to perform tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Agent as the Central Unit:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> is the fundamental building block – the individual agent that executes tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Communication (Bus):</strong> The <code>IAgentParams</code> interface highlights the importance of the <code>bus</code> (a messaging system) for agents to communicate and coordinate.</li>
<li><strong>History Management:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> and <code>IAgentParams</code> emphasize the agent's ability to operate without relying on conversation history (using the <code>run</code> method).</li>
<li><strong>Tool Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>call</code> and <code>execute</code> methods are central to running tools within the agent.</li>
<li><strong>Schema &amp; Configuration:</strong> The <code>IAgentSchema</code> defines the configuration for each agent, including its tools, prompt, and completion mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interface Breakdown &amp; Key Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a summary of each interface and its role:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>IAgent</code>:</strong> The core runtime agent.  Handles independent execution, tool calls, message commitment, and lifecycle management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentParams</code>:</strong>  Provides the agent with the necessary parameters for operation, including its ID, logging, communication channel, and history management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchema</code>:</strong> Defines the configuration settings for an agent (tools, prompt, completion mechanism).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchemaCallbacks</code>:</strong>  Provides callbacks for managing different stages of an agent’s lifecycle (init, run, output, etc.).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentConnectionService</code>:</strong> A type definition for an <code>AgentConnectionService</code> – a service that manages connections between the agents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Workflow Implications</strong></p>
<p>Based on these interfaces, here’s a workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Agent Configuration:</strong> An <code>IAgentSchema</code> is created to define the agent’s settings.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Instantiation:</strong> An <code>IAgent</code> instance is created based on the schema.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>execute</code> method is called to initiate independent operation.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Calls:</strong>  The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>call</code> to execute tools.</li>
<li><strong>Message Handling:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>commitToolOutput</code>, <code>commitSystemMessage</code>, and <code>commitUserMessage</code> to manage messages.</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses the <code>bus</code> (via <code>IAgentParams</code>) to communicate with other agents.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key Concepts &amp; Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> Agents maintain their own state (conversation history, tool outputs, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Decoupling:</strong> The interfaces are designed to decouple different components of the system. This allows for flexibility and easier maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Event-Driven Architecture:</strong> The use of callbacks suggests an event-driven architecture, where components communicate through events rather than direct calls.</li>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> The interfaces highlight the importance of managing the agent's state, including conversation history, tool output, and system messages.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Integration:</strong> The <code>tools</code> property in <code>IAgentParams</code> indicates a system designed to integrate with external tools.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous Communication:</strong> Agents communicate asynchronously via a bus, allowing them to operate independently.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The system is designed to be flexible, a</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Use Cases:</strong></p>
<p>This architecture could be used for a wide range of applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chatbots:</strong>  Agents could be used to power conversational AI systems.</li>
<li><strong>Content Generation:</strong> Agents could be used to generate text, images, or other content.</li>
<li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Agents could be used to analyze data and generate insights.</li>

You provide the message content and a unique identifier for the client session to use this function.</p>
<a id="function-runstateless" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function runStateless<a href="#function-runstateless" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you send a message to a specific agent within your swarm without adding it to the ongoing conversation history. Think of it as a way to run a quick task or process some data using an agent without cluttering up the chat log – useful for things like handling file uploads or one-time operations.</p>
<p>You provide the message content, a client identifier to track the session, and the name of the agent you want to use. The system verifies everything is working correctly, ensures the agent is still active, and then runs the message. This helps prevent issues with long chat histories and keeps things organized. The execution is carefully managed to provide a fresh environment and track important details.</p>
<a id="function-questionforce" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function questionForce<a href="#function-questionforce" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you trigger a specific question-answering process, essentially forcing a response based on the provided message. It's useful when you need to ensure a particular query is addressed within a conversation. You provide the message you want to use, a unique identifier for the client interacting, and the name of the knowledge base (wiki) to draw from. The function will then return a string, which represents the response generated by the orchestrated AI agents. Think of it as a way to directly prompt the swarm to focus on a specific question.</p>
<a id="function-question" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function question<a href="#function-question" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you send a question or message to an AI agent within a specific conversation and context. Think of it as the primary way to interact with your agents. You need to provide the actual message you want to send, a unique ID for the conversation, the name of the AI agent you want to involve, and the knowledge base (wiki) it should use to answer. The function then handles the complex steps needed to process the message and get a response back, ultimately returning the agent's reply.</p>
<a id="function-overridewiki" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideWiki<a href="#function-overridewiki" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you replace or update the configuration of a wiki within the AI agent swarm. You provide a new schema definition, and it applies those changes directly to the wiki’s settings. Think of it as a way to quickly adjust a wiki’s structure and properties.

It's like putting a pause button on a particular agent's actions.</p>
<p>It carefully checks that you're asking to stop the right agent and that everything is set up correctly.</p>
<p>Think of it as a way to manage the flow of tasks for an agent, similar to how <code>commitFlush</code> manages the agent’s memory but instead of clearing it, it temporarily prevents further tools from running.</p>
<p>You’re telling the system, &quot;Don't let this agent run any more tools for now,&quot; and it does so while keeping track of what’s happening and verifying everything along the way.</p>
<p>It needs the client’s unique ID and the agent’s name to perform this action.</p>

Think of it as the fundamental unit of communication – it’s what agents, tools, users, and the system itself use to talk to each other. It’s crucial for keeping track of what's happened, generating responses, and broadcasting events across the swarm.</p>
<p>Each message has a <code>role</code> indicating who or what sent it (like a user, an assistant model, or a tool). There's also an <code>agentName</code> to identify which specific agent created the message, especially important in swarms with multiple agents working together. The <code>content</code> is the actual text or data being transmitted.</p>
<p>To clarify the origin of the message, there's an <code>mode</code> property, which helps distinguish between user inputs and tool outputs. If a model wants a tool to run, the message might include <code>tool_calls</code> – a list of instructions for those tools. You can also find optional <code>images</code> or a more detailed <code>payload</code> attached to the message if needed. Finally, the <code>tool_call_id</code> connects a tool's output to its originating request.</p>

<p>Similarly, <code>useChatCallbacks</code> allows you to customize how your AI agents respond to events and actions within the chat, letting you tweak their behavior and add extra functionality. You can provide a set of functions that the system will call at specific moments, effectively plugging in your own logic.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatargs" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatArgs<a href="#interface-ichatargs" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface, <code>IChatArgs</code>, defines the data needed for a chat interaction within the AI agent swarm. Think of it as a standard container for the information being passed between components. Each chat request needs a <code>clientId</code>, which is a unique way to identify where the request came from. You also need to specify which <code>agentName</code> is responsible for handling the conversation. Finally, the core of the interaction is the <code>message</code> itself, which is the actual text being sent or received.</p>
<a id="interface-ibuseventcontext" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBusEventContext<a href="#interface-ibuseventcontext" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface helps give events more context within the swarm system. Think of it as a way to tag an event with information about which agent, swarm, storage, state, compute, or policy it relates to.</p>
<p>When an agent is doing something, like a ClientAgent, it will usually just include the agent’s name in this context. However, other parts of the system, like when a swarm is managing tasks or a policy is being applied, might use all these fields to provide more details about what's happening.</p>
<p>It's a way to connect events to specific components within the swarm, making it easier to track and understand what's going on. Each field – agentName, swarmName, storageName, stateName, computeName, and policyName – represents a unique identifier for those respective components.</p>
<a id="interface-ibusevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBusEvent<a href="#interface-ibusevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface describes the structure of messages sent across the swarm system's internal communication channels. Think of it as a standardized way for different parts of the system, particularly agents, to tell each other what's happening.</p>
<p>Each message has a <code>source</code> indicating where it came from (usually &quot;agent-bus&quot; for messages originating from an agent), a <code>type</code> which defines the action being performed (like &quot;run&quot; or &quot;commit-user-message&quot;), and <code>input</code> and <code>output</code> sections to carry any relevant data.  There's also a <code>context</code> section that provides additional information, typically including the agent's name.  This consistent format allows the system to understand and react appropriately to different events.</p>
<a id="interface-ibus" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBus<a href="#interface-ibus" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>IBus</code> interface acts as a central communication channel within the swarm system. It allows agents to send notifications and updates to specific clients, promoting a loosely coupled architecture. Think of it as a way for different parts of the system to talk to each other without needing to know the details of how the other part works.</p>
<p>Agents use the <code>emit</code> method to broadcast events like message commitments, tool executions, or the completion of tasks. These events are structured and follow a standard format, including information about the event's type, origin, data, and the target client. The <code>emit</code> method sends these events asynchronously, meaning they’re queued for delivery rather than processed immediately.</p>
<p>The <code>clientId</code> in the event is a key piece of information, ensuring that messages reach the correct recipient.  This method is often used to keep clients informed of activity within the system, like updates to history or results from tools. Events often contain information about the origin agent, ensuring accountability and traceability. The generic type <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> helps maintain a consistent structure for the events being sent.</p>
<a id="interface-ibaseevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBaseEvent<a href="#interface-ibaseevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface sets the groundwork for all events happening within the AI agent swarm. Every event, no matter its purpose, will have a <code>source</code> to tell you where it came from and a <code>clientId</code> to specify which agent or session it's intended for. Think of the <code>source</code> as the event's origin point – like &quot;custom-source&quot; for a basic event or &quot;agent-bus&quot; when it’s coming from an agent. The <code>clientId</code> acts like a delivery address, guaranteeing the message gets to the right place within your system, such as a specific user session.</p>
<a id="interface-iagenttoolcallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentToolCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagenttoolcallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you customize how individual tools within your AI agent swarm operate. You can use these callbacks to track what’s happening, make sure things are set up correctly before a tool runs, or handle errors that might occur.</p>
<p>Specifically, <code>onBeforeCall</code> lets you run code just before a tool is used – think of it as a chance to log the call or prepare some data. <code>onAfterCall</code> is its counterpart, running after the tool has finished, perfect for cleanup or confirming results.</p>
<p><code>onValidate</code> gives you the power to ensure the input parameters for a tool are correct before it even starts, preventing unexpected problems. Finally, <code>onCallError</code> helps you gracefully manage any errors that happen during tool execution, allowing you to log them or even attempt to recover.</p>
<a id="interface-iagenttool" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentTool<a href="#interface-iagenttool" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface, <code>IAgentTool</code>, describes a tool that an AI agent can use within a swarm. Each tool needs a name to be recognized, and a way to check if it's ready to be used – maybe it depends on some external resource.</p>
<p>Before a tool runs, it’s important to make sure the input is correct, which is handled by a validation step. You can also add optional callbacks to customize how the tool behaves during its lifecycle.</p>
<p>The <code>call</code> method is how the tool is actually executed, taking into account the client, agent, parameters, and other context. A dynamic factory is also provided for resolving tool metadata.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemainternalcallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaInternalCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagentschemainternalcallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface provides a way to plug in custom actions at different points in an agent's lifecycle. You can use these callbacks to monitor what the agent is doing, log important events, or even influence its behavior.</p>
<p>There are callbacks for when the agent starts (<code>onInit</code>), runs a stateless action (<code>onRun</code>), begins execution (<code>onExecute</code>), tools produce output (<code>onToolOutput</code>), system or developer messages are generated, and when a tool request is made (<code>onToolRequest</code>). You can also hook into events like tool errors (<code>onToolError</code>), assistant and user messages, history flushing (<code>onFlush</code>), and agent disposal (<code>onDispose</code>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, there’s a callback that fires when an agent is revived after a pause or failure (<code>onResurrect</code>), one for when the agent generates a final output (<code>onOutput</code>), and one for after all tools have been called (<code>onAfterToolCalls</code>). Each callback provides details like client ID, agent name, and relevant data for the specific event.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemainternal" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaInternal<a href="#interface-iagentschemainternal" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how an agent is configured within the system. It describes all the settings that shape an agent's behavior, from its name and core prompt to the tools it can use and how it interacts with other agents.</p>
<p>You can specify the agent's purpose with a <code>prompt</code> and provide additional context with <code>system</code> prompts. The <code>tools</code> and <code>storages</code> arrays list the resources the agent has access to. The <code>dependsOn</code> property allows an agent to rely on the output or state of another agent.</p>
<p>The system provides ways to control the agent’s actions: you can limit the number of tool calls with <code>maxToolCalls</code> and manage the size of the conversation history with <code>keepMessages</code>.  There’s a way to adjust the agent's output before it's used, either by validating it with a <code>validate</code> function or transforming it with a <code>transform</code> function. Finally, <code>callbacks</code> let you customize specific moments in the agent’s lifecycle.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemacallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagentschemacallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines a set of optional callbacks that you can use to monitor and react to different stages of an agent's lifecycle. Think of them as hooks that allow you to tap into what's happening behind the scenes as the agent runs – whether it's when it first starts, when it's using tools, generating output, or even recovering from a pause. You can use these callbacks for things like logging, debugging, or custom integrations.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of what each callback does:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>onRun</code>: Notifies you when the agent executes without saving any history.</li>
<li><code>onExecute</code>: Lets you know when an agent starts running.</li>
<li><code>onToolOutput</code>: Signals when a tool used by the agent has produced a result.</li>
<li><code>onSystemMessage</code>:  Alerts you to any messages generated by the system related to the agent.</li>
<li><code>onToolRequest</code>: Triggers when the agent needs to use a tool, giving you a chance to handle the request.</li>
<li><code>onAssistantMessage</code>: Informs you when the agent commits a message.</li>
<li><code>onUserMessage</code>:  Notifies you when a user sends a message to the agent.</li>
<li><code>onFlush</code>:  Indicates that the agent's history is being cleared.</li>
<li><code>onOutput</code>:  Signals that the agent has produced some output.</li>
<li><code>onResurrect</code>:  Lets you know when the agent is restarted after a pause or error.</li>
<li><code>onInit</code>:  Provides a notification when the agent is initialized.</li>
<li><code>onDispose</code>:  Signals that the agent is being shut down.</li>
<li><code>onAfterToolCalls</code>:  Alerts you when all the tools the agent planned to use in a sequence have finished.</li>
</ul>

It allows you to specify instructions and context for each agent using system prompts.</p>
<p>You can provide static system prompts directly as strings or arrays of strings.  The <code>systemStatic</code> property is simply another way to define those static prompts.</p>
<p>For more complex scenarios, the <code>systemDynamic</code> property lets you create system prompts that change based on the agent's identity and the current context. This is achieved with a function that generates prompts dynamically.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentparams" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentParams<a href="#interface-iagentparams" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how an individual agent within the system operates. It bundles together essential components like a unique client ID, a logging system for tracking activity, and a communication bus to interact with other agents. Agents also have access to tools for performing actions, a history tracker, and a completion mechanism to generate final results. Furthermore, there's a validation step to ensure the agent's output is correct before it's finalized. Think of it as a blueprint for how each agent knows who it is, what it can do, and how it fits within the larger swarm.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentnavigationparams" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentNavigationParams<a href="#interface-iagentnavigationparams" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface helps you define how an agent should move or interact with other agents within the system. Think of it as a set of instructions for an agent’s journey. You specify the tool's name and what it does with a description. You also tell it which agent it needs to reach using <code>navigateTo</code>. Finally, you can add some extra notes for documentation purposes with the <code>docNote</code> field.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentconnectionservice" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentConnectionService<a href="#interface-iagentconnectionservice" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface helps define how different AI agents connect and communicate within the system. Think of it as a blueprint for establishing links between agents, but it's designed to focus on the parts that are meant to be public and accessible, hiding the underlying technical details. It ensures that the external-facing services related to agent connections are well-defined and consistent.</p>
<a id="interface-iagent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgent<a href="#interface-iagent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how you interact with an individual agent within a larger orchestration system. You can use the <code>run</code> method for quick, isolated tasks without affecting the agent’s memory. The <code>execute</code> method is used for regular operations that might update the agent's history.</p>
<p>To manage the agent’s state and memory, you have several commit methods. These let you add messages – user inputs, system instructions, tool outputs, and developer messages – to the agent’s history.  You can also submit tool requests and handle assistant responses.</p>
<p>The interface provides ways to control the agent’s flow, like flushing its memory, stopping tool execution, and canceling ongoing outputs. These methods give you fine-grained control over the agent’s behavior and lifecycle.</p>
