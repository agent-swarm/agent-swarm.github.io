<p><strong>Overall Architecture:</strong></p>
<p>This system built around a distributed, asynchronous architecture. Agents communicate via a message queue, and their interactions are orchestrated through a series of tools and processes. The core concept is to allow agents to perform tasks independently while still being part of a larger, coordinated system.</p>
<p><strong>Core Concepts &amp; Relationships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swarm Orchestration:</strong> The entire framework is built around orchestrating agents to perform tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Agent as the Central Unit:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> is the fundamental building block – the individual agent that executes tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Communication (Bus):</strong> The <code>IAgentParams</code> interface highlights the importance of the <code>bus</code> (a messaging system) for agents to communicate and coordinate.</li>
<li><strong>History Management:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> and <code>IAgentParams</code> emphasize the agent's ability to operate without relying on conversation history (using the <code>run</code> method).</li>
<li><strong>Tool Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>call</code> and <code>execute</code> methods are central to running tools within the agent.</li>
<li><strong>Schema &amp; Configuration:</strong> The <code>IAgentSchema</code> defines the configuration for each agent, including its tools, prompt, and completion mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interface Breakdown &amp; Key Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a summary of each interface and its role:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>IAgent</code>:</strong> The core runtime agent.  Handles independent execution, tool calls, message commitment, and lifecycle management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentParams</code>:</strong>  Provides the agent with the necessary parameters for operation, including its ID, logging, communication channel, and history management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchema</code>:</strong> Defines the configuration settings for an agent (tools, prompt, completion mechanism).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchemaCallbacks</code>:</strong>  Provides callbacks for managing different stages of an agent’s lifecycle (init, run, output, etc.).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentConnectionService</code>:</strong> A type definition for an <code>AgentConnectionService</code> – a service that manages connections between the agents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Workflow Implications</strong></p>
<p>Based on these interfaces, here’s a workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Agent Configuration:</strong> An <code>IAgentSchema</code> is created to define the agent’s settings.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Instantiation:</strong> An <code>IAgent</code> instance is created based on the schema.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>execute</code> method is called to initiate independent operation.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Calls:</strong>  The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>call</code> to execute tools.</li>
<li><strong>Message Handling:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>commitToolOutput</code>, <code>commitSystemMessage</code>, and <code>commitUserMessage</code> to manage messages.</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses the <code>bus</code> (via <code>IAgentParams</code>) to communicate with other agents.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key Concepts &amp; Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> Agents maintain their own state (conversation history, tool outputs, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Decoupling:</strong> The interfaces are designed to decouple different components of the system. This allows for flexibility and easier maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Event-Driven Architecture:</strong> The use of callbacks suggests an event-driven architecture, where components communicate through events rather than direct calls.</li>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> The interfaces highlight the importance of managing the agent's state, including conversation history, tool output, and system messages.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Integration:</strong> The <code>tools</code> property in <code>IAgentParams</code> indicates a system designed to integrate with external tools.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous Communication:</strong> Agents communicate asynchronously via a bus, allowing them to operate independently.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The system is designed to be flexible, a</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Use Cases:</strong></p>
<p>This architecture could be used for a wide range of applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chatbots:</strong>  Agents could be used to power conversational AI systems.</li>
<li><strong>Content Generation:</strong> Agents could be used to generate text, images, or other content.</li>
<li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Agents could be used to analyze data and generate insights.</li>

Think of it as a health check for your AI agent system. It's safe to run it multiple times because it only does the validation once each time it’s called, so you don't have to worry about it slowing things down.</p>
<a id="function-startpipeline" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function startPipeline<a href="#function-startpipeline" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you kick off a predefined workflow, or &quot;pipeline,&quot; using a specific AI agent. Think of it as telling the system, &quot;Hey, run this sequence of tasks, using this particular agent, and here's some extra information it might need.&quot; You’ll need to provide a unique identifier for your client, the name of the pipeline you want to run, and the agent responsible for handling it.  Optionally, you can provide some data, called a payload, to help the agent perform its tasks. The function will then return a result based on the pipeline's execution.</p>
<a id="function-scope" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function scope<a href="#function-scope" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you run a piece of code within a defined environment, essentially providing it with a set of tools and resources. You give it a function you want to execute, and it handles setting up the necessary context around it. You can also customize which tools – like AI agents or data processing pipelines – the function has access to, by providing optional settings. If you don’t customize, it will use the standard tools already set up in the system. This makes it easy to control and manage how your code interacts with the larger AI agent swarm.</p>
<a id="function-runstatelessforce" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function runStatelessForce<a href="#function-runstatelessforce" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you send a message to your active AI agent without saving it to the conversation history. It’s useful for tasks like processing data from external systems or running quick, isolated actions where you don't want the history to grow too large.</p>
<p>Unlike other functions, this one <em>always</em> executes the message, even if the agent has changed or isn’t currently active. It handles the necessary setup, tracks performance, and notifies related systems, ensuring the task gets done in a controlled and monitored way. You provide the message you want the agent to process and a unique identifier for your client session.</p>
<a id="function-runstateless" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function runStateless<a href="#function-runstateless" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you quickly run a command or message through an agent without it being recorded in the chat history. It's perfect for situations where you need to process data or perform a one-off task and don't want to clutter the conversation history, like when dealing with file uploads or handling data that shouldn't be part of the ongoing conversation.</p>
<p>The function ensures the agent is available and active before running the command and keeps track of how long the execution takes. It sets up a fresh environment for the agent to work in, ensuring a clean and consistent result. If the agent assigned to the session has changed, the command won’t be executed to prevent unexpected behavior.</p>
<p>You provide the message you want the agent to process, a unique identifier for your session, and the name of the agent you want to use. The function then returns the result of the agent's execution.</p>
<a id="function-questionforce" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function questionForce<a href="#function-questionforce" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you directly trigger a focused question generation process for an AI agent swarm. Think of it as a way to prompt the system to dig deeper and provide a more specific answer based on a given message or question. You’re essentially telling the system, &quot;I want a targeted response, using this input and considering this specific knowledge base.&quot; You'll need to provide the actual message you want answered, a unique identifier for who’s asking, and the name of the relevant knowledge source to guide the agents. The function then returns the generated response.</p>
<a id="function-question" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function question<a href="#function-question" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you send a question to your AI agent swarm. It’s the starting point for getting answers within a conversation. You provide the question itself, a unique identifier for who's asking, the name of the agent responsible for answering, and the specific knowledge base (wiki) the agent should use. The function will then return the agent's response to your question.</p>
<a id="function-overridewiki" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideWiki<a href="#function-overridewiki" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you update a wiki's configuration within the swarm system. Think of it as a way to make changes to a wiki's settings, like its structure or rules, by providing a new or modified version of its schema. The function ensures these changes are made in a controlled way, separate from any ongoing processes.  If logging is turned on, the system will record that this wiki schema was changed. You provide the updated schema information as input, and it applies those changes to the existing wiki.</p>
<a id="function-overridetool" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideTool<a href="#function-overridetool" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you modify the details of a tool already registered within the swarm system. Think of it as updating a tool's instructions or capabilities. You provide a new or partial schema, and the function applies those changes, ensuring the update happens independently of any ongoing tasks.

<p>When an agent is directly involved, like in a typical client agent scenario, you're most likely to see the <code>agentName</code> filled in. However, other fields like <code>swarmName</code>, <code>storageName</code>, and <code>policyName</code> are available to provide more context for system-wide events. Essentially, it's a way to specify which agent, swarm, storage, state, compute, or policy is related to a particular event.</p>
<a id="interface-ibusevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBusEvent<a href="#interface-ibusevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the structure of messages sent across the internal communication system within the swarm. Think of it as a standardized way for different parts of the system, especially agents, to talk to each other and share information.</p>
<p>Each message uses a specific source to identify where it’s coming from (usually “agent-bus” for messages originating from an agent). It also has a type that describes what the message is about – for instance, &quot;run&quot; to signal a task starting or &quot;commit-user-message&quot; to share a user's input.</p>
<p>Messages can also carry data, split into ‘input’ and ‘output’ sections, to pass relevant details.  A ‘context’ section allows for adding extra information about the message, like which agent sent it. This makes it clear where actions are originating and provides important metadata for understanding the event.</p>
<a id="interface-ibus" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBus<a href="#interface-ibus" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>IBus</code> interface acts as a central communication hub for the swarm system. It allows different parts of the system, especially agents, to send updates and information to specific clients in a reliable and asynchronous way. Think of it as a delivery service that ensures everyone gets the messages they need.</p>
<p>The core function, <code>emit</code>, is how agents broadcast updates. When an agent needs to notify the system about something – whether that’s finishing a task, sending output, or confirming a commit – it uses <code>emit</code> to send a structured event to a specific client. These events follow a standard format, including details like the event type, the agent that sent it, the data involved, and the target client's ID.</p>
<p>This system keeps things organized by allowing agents to operate independently while still keeping the entire swarm system aware of what's happening. The <code>clientId</code> within the event reinforces the target for delivery, ensuring updates reach the right place. It's a type-safe way to share information and maintain a synchronized experience for everyone involved.</p>

Think of it as the basic template for any message being sent between agents, sessions, or other parts of the system.</p>
<p>Every event needs to have a <code>source</code> - a way to identify where the event came from, like a specific agent or bus. It also needs a <code>clientId</code> to ensure the message is delivered to the correct client or agent instance. These two properties guarantee events are properly routed and understood throughout the swarm.</p>

It provides specific points where you can hook in your own code to do things like log activity, check if a tool is ready to run, or handle errors that might occur.</p>
<p>You can use <code>onBeforeCall</code> to run code right before a tool starts its work – think of it as a setup or preparation step.  <code>onAfterCall</code> lets you run code after the tool finishes, which could be for cleanup or reviewing the results.</p>
<p><code>onValidate</code> is helpful if you need to make sure the information passed to a tool is correct before it even starts running. Finally, <code>onCallError</code> is there to help you deal with any problems that might happen during a tool’s execution, allowing you to log errors or attempt recovery.</p>
<a id="interface-iagenttool" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentTool<a href="#interface-iagenttool" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines what a tool looks like within our agent swarm system. Each tool has a unique name and a description to help users understand how to use it.</p>
<p>Before a tool can run, it checks if it's currently available, potentially based on the client or agent involved. It also validates the input parameters to ensure they're correct.</p>
<p>You can add optional lifecycle callbacks to customize how the tool behaves during execution. The tool itself is identified by a type, which currently should be <code>function</code>, and it has a method called <code>call</code> that handles the actual execution with provided data like client ID, agent name, and parameters. This <code>call</code> method handles the tool's logic with provided context.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemainternalcallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaInternalCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagentschemainternalcallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you hook into different stages of an agent's lifecycle, giving you opportunities to monitor or react to what's happening. You can provide callbacks for when an agent starts running, when it produces output, or when a tool generates results. There are also hooks for handling errors, dealing with system messages, and managing the agent’s history, including when it's cleared or restarted. This gives you fine-grained control and visibility into the agent’s behavior. You can also listen for initialization and disposal events, and events triggered after all tools have completed their calls.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemainternal" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaInternal<a href="#interface-iagentschemainternal" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how an AI agent is configured within the swarm. Think of it as a blueprint that describes the agent’s personality, capabilities, and how it interacts with other agents and systems.</p>
<p>The agent has a unique name to identify it within the swarm. It also has a primary prompt that guides its behavior, and optionally, a description for documentation purposes.</p>
<p>The agent can use tools to interact with the environment; you can limit the number of tools it uses, and even modify the tool calls before they’re executed. It’s also possible to define system prompts to guide tool-calling protocols.</p>
<p>You can control the agent's memory by setting a maximum number of messages to keep in context.  The agent can also depend on other agents to handle different tasks or transitions.</p>
<p>There are several optional functions to customize the agent’s behavior: a validation function to check the agent’s output, a transformation function to alter the output, and a mapping function to process assistant messages.  Finally, you can define lifecycle callbacks to further fine-tune how the agent executes its tasks, and if the agent is an operator, it can handle chat passing to operator dashboard.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemacallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagentschemacallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you hook into different stages of an agent's lifecycle. You can use these callbacks to monitor what the agent is doing, react to specific events, or even influence its behavior. For example, you can be notified when the agent starts running, when a tool generates output, or when the agent's memory is cleared. These callbacks give you flexibility in how you manage and observe your AI agents. You can also react to tool requests, assistant or user messages, or when an agent is restarted after an interruption.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschema" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchema<a href="#interface-iagentschema" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the structure for describing an AI agent within the orchestration framework. Think of it as a blueprint for creating agents.</p>
<p>It lets you specify what instructions or &quot;system prompts&quot; you want the agent to follow. You can provide these instructions directly as a single string or as an array of strings for more complex scenarios.</p>
<p>There are three ways to define these instructions: a static set, a static alias for system, or a dynamic set generated by a function. The dynamic approach allows you to customize the agent's instructions based on factors like the client ID or the agent's name, making each agent more adaptable to different situations.</p>

Think of it as the agent's configuration file. It includes things like a unique identifier for the client using the agent, a way to log activities, a communication channel within the larger system, a tool for calling external tools, a record of past interactions, and a mechanism for generating responses.  You can also provide a list of tools the agent can use and a function to check the agent's output before it's considered finished.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentnavigationparams" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentNavigationParams<a href="#interface-iagentnavigationparams" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the settings you can use to tell an agent how to move and interact with other agents within the system. Think of it as a blueprint for instructing an agent to use a specific tool, explaining what that tool does, specifying which agent it should interact with, and optionally providing extra notes about its use. It lets you precisely control how agents connect and collaborate. The <code>toolName</code> specifies what the agent will use, <code>description</code> helps understand what it does, <code>navigateTo</code> identifies the target agent, and <code>docNote</code> allows for optional additional information.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentconnectionservice" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentConnectionService<a href="#interface-iagentconnectionservice" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface helps us clearly define how different agents connect and communicate within the system. Think of it as a blueprint that ensures the public-facing connection methods are consistent and reliable. It's designed to strip away any internal workings, so developers only see the core functionality for agent connections. This helps keep things organized and predictable when building and using the agent swarm.</p>
<a id="interface-iagent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgent<a href="#interface-iagent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>IAgent</code> interface defines how individual AI agents within a larger orchestration framework behave and interact.  It provides methods for running agents, executing commands that potentially update their internal history, and retrieving outputs.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>run</code> method for quick, stateless computations with an agent, while <code>execute</code> handles more involved processes that might change the agent's memory.</p>
<p>To manage the agent’s workflow, methods like <code>commitToolOutput</code>, <code>commitSystemMessage</code>, and <code>commitUserMessage</code> allow you to add information to its history.  You can also control tool requests with <code>commitToolRequest</code> and pause or cancel tool execution using methods like <code>commitStopTools</code> or <code>commitCancelOutput</code>. Finally, <code>commitFlush</code> provides a way to completely reset an agent to its initial state.</p>
