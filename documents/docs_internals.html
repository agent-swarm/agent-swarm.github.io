<p><strong>Overall Architecture:</strong></p>
<p>This system built around a distributed, asynchronous architecture. Agents communicate via a message queue, and their interactions are orchestrated through a series of tools and processes. The core concept is to allow agents to perform tasks independently while still being part of a larger, coordinated system.</p>
<p><strong>Core Concepts &amp; Relationships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swarm Orchestration:</strong> The entire framework is built around orchestrating agents to perform tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Agent as the Central Unit:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> is the fundamental building block – the individual agent that executes tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Communication (Bus):</strong> The <code>IAgentParams</code> interface highlights the importance of the <code>bus</code> (a messaging system) for agents to communicate and coordinate.</li>
<li><strong>History Management:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> and <code>IAgentParams</code> emphasize the agent's ability to operate without relying on conversation history (using the <code>run</code> method).</li>
<li><strong>Tool Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>call</code> and <code>execute</code> methods are central to running tools within the agent.</li>
<li><strong>Schema &amp; Configuration:</strong> The <code>IAgentSchema</code> defines the configuration for each agent, including its tools, prompt, and completion mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interface Breakdown &amp; Key Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a summary of each interface and its role:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>IAgent</code>:</strong> The core runtime agent.  Handles independent execution, tool calls, message commitment, and lifecycle management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentParams</code>:</strong>  Provides the agent with the necessary parameters for operation, including its ID, logging, communication channel, and history management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchema</code>:</strong> Defines the configuration settings for an agent (tools, prompt, completion mechanism).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchemaCallbacks</code>:</strong>  Provides callbacks for managing different stages of an agent’s lifecycle (init, run, output, etc.).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentConnectionService</code>:</strong> A type definition for an <code>AgentConnectionService</code> – a service that manages connections between the agents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Workflow Implications</strong></p>
<p>Based on these interfaces, here’s a workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Agent Configuration:</strong> An <code>IAgentSchema</code> is created to define the agent’s settings.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Instantiation:</strong> An <code>IAgent</code> instance is created based on the schema.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>execute</code> method is called to initiate independent operation.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Calls:</strong>  The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>call</code> to execute tools.</li>
<li><strong>Message Handling:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>commitToolOutput</code>, <code>commitSystemMessage</code>, and <code>commitUserMessage</code> to manage messages.</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses the <code>bus</code> (via <code>IAgentParams</code>) to communicate with other agents.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key Concepts &amp; Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> Agents maintain their own state (conversation history, tool outputs, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Decoupling:</strong> The interfaces are designed to decouple different components of the system. This allows for flexibility and easier maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Event-Driven Architecture:</strong> The use of callbacks suggests an event-driven architecture, where components communicate through events rather than direct calls.</li>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> The interfaces highlight the importance of managing the agent's state, including conversation history, tool output, and system messages.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Integration:</strong> The <code>tools</code> property in <code>IAgentParams</code> indicates a system designed to integrate with external tools.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous Communication:</strong> Agents communicate asynchronously via a bus, allowing them to operate independently.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The system is designed to be flexible, a</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Use Cases:</strong></p>
<p>This architecture could be used for a wide range of applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chatbots:</strong>  Agents could be used to power conversational AI systems.</li>
<li><strong>Content Generation:</strong> Agents could be used to generate text, images, or other content.</li>
<li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Agents could be used to analyze data and generate insights.</li>
</ul>

You tell it which client is requesting the work, the specific pipeline you want to run, and which agent should handle it. You can also include some data, called a payload, to help the pipeline do its job. The function will then start the pipeline and eventually return a result, the type of which you can define when you call it. Think of it as the primary way to tell your agent swarm, &quot;Hey, do this thing!&quot;</p>
<a id="function-scope" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function scope<a href="#function-scope" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you run a piece of code – like a task or a small process – inside a defined environment. Think of it as giving your code a specific set of tools and rules to work with.</p>
<p>You provide the code you want to run, and this function handles setting up the necessary environment for it.  You can also customize which tools are available to your code by providing options to adjust things like the AI agents, how text is generated, or the workflow pipelines. If you don't customize, it will use the default tools provided by the overall system.</p>
<a id="function-runstatelessforce" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function runStatelessForce<a href="#function-runstatelessforce" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you quickly run a message through your AI agent swarm without adding it to the chat history. Think of it as a way to execute commands like processing data or performing one-off tasks without worrying about the history getting too long.</p>
<p>It's different from other functions because it <em>always</em> runs the message, even if the agent isn't currently active. You provide the message content and a client identifier to track the request, and the system handles the rest, ensuring a fresh execution environment and keeping track of performance.</p>
<a id="function-runstateless" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function runStateless<a href="#function-runstateless" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you send a single message to an agent in your swarm without it being saved as part of a conversation history. It's perfect for tasks like processing data from external sources or running quick, isolated commands where you don't want to clutter the chat log.</p>
<p>Essentially, you provide the message you want the agent to handle, a unique identifier for your client, and the name of the agent you want to use. The function takes care of checking that the agent is still available and then runs the message, keeping track of how long it takes. It ensures a fresh execution environment for each command. If the assigned agent has been replaced, the function skips the execution to avoid inconsistencies.</p>
<a id="function-questionforce" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function questionForce<a href="#function-questionforce" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you trigger a specific type of question-answering process, even if it might not naturally arise from a conversation. It’s useful when you need to ensure a particular query is addressed within a defined knowledge base. You provide the actual question you want answered, a unique identifier for the system using the question, and the name of the specific knowledge source (wiki) to use for finding the answer. The function then returns the answer it finds.</p>
<a id="function-question" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function question<a href="#function-question" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you send a question or message to an AI agent swarm for processing. It's designed to work within a conversation, associating the question with a specific client, a designated agent, and a relevant knowledge base (wiki). You provide the text of the question, a unique ID for the client asking it, the name of the agent responsible for answering, and the name of the wiki the agent should use to find information. The function then returns the agent's response as a string.</p>
<p>Essentially, it's the entry point for getting answers from your AI agent swarm.</p>
<a id="function-overridewiki" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideWiki<a href="#function-overridewiki" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you update the settings for a wiki within the swarm. Think of it as a way to change how a specific wiki operates, whether you're making a small tweak or completely redefining its structure. It's designed to be a direct and isolated operation, ensuring it doesn't interfere with other processes. The function applies the changes you provide, potentially altering aspects like its data structure or behavior. If logging is turned on, it will record that you’re making this change. You provide a set of properties that define how you want the wiki to be modified.</p>
<a id="function-overridetool" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideTool<a href="#function-overridetool" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you modify the way a tool behaves within the AI agent swarm. Think of it as updating a tool's instructions – you can change its capabilities or how it responds to requests. The changes are applied directly to the tool's configuration, ensuring a clear and isolated update process. It’s like giving a tool a quick refresher to improve its performance or adapt to new requirements. You can provide a complete new schema or just a few changes to an existing tool.</p>
<a id="function-overrideswarm" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideSwarm<a href="#function-overrideswarm" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you directly change the setup of a swarm within the system. Think of it as providing a new blueprint for how a swarm operates. You can provide a complete new schema or just a few tweaks to an existing one, and it will update the swarm’s configuration. It works independently, ensuring a fresh start for the update process. If logging is turned on, the system will record that this change happened.

<a id="function-overridestorage" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideStorage<a href="#function-overridestorage" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you change how your swarm system handles data storage. It allows you to update the configuration for a specific storage location, either by completely replacing the existing setup or just modifying parts of it.  Think of it as tweaking the rules for how data is saved and retrieved. It works independently of any ongoing processes, making sure the change is applied cleanly.  If your system is set up to record actions, this override will be logged for tracking purposes. You can provide just a portion of the storage schema to update, extending the default <code>IStorageSchema</code>.</p>
<a id="function-overridestate" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideState<a href="#function-overridestate" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you change the structure and properties of a state within the agent swarm. Think of it as modifying the blueprint for how information is stored and shared. You can provide a new or partial schema to update an existing one, and it ensures the change happens cleanly and independently. The system will log this change if logging is turned on, allowing you to track schema modifications. You essentially use this to fine-tune how your swarm manages its data.</p>

Think of it as sending a direct announcement or status update.</p>
<p>It's specifically for sessions created using the &quot;makeConnection&quot; method and ensures the agent you're sending to is still running. It prepares a fresh environment for the notification and logs what’s happening, and won’t work if your session wasn't established with &quot;makeConnection&quot;.</p>
<p>You provide the message content and a client ID to identify where the notification is coming from.</p>
<a id="function-notify" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function notify<a href="#function-notify" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you send a simple notification message out from your AI agent swarm without triggering any further actions. Think of it as a way to broadcast a message directly to a connected session. It’s specifically for sessions created with “makeConnection,” and it makes sure the agent you’re sending the message through is still available before sending anything. The function also sets up a fresh environment for the message and keeps a log of the operation – and it won't work if the session wasn't created with “makeConnection.”</p>
<p>You provide the notification message itself (the <code>content</code>), a unique ID for the client sending it (<code>clientId</code>), and the name of the agent that should be associated with the notification (<code>agentName</code>).</p>
<a id="function-markonline" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function markOnline<a href="#function-markonline" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you tell the system that a particular client is now active and participating in a specific swarm. Think of it as a simple &quot;hello, I'm ready!&quot; signal. You provide the unique ID of the client and the name of the swarm they belong to, and the system updates its records to reflect their online status. It's useful for keeping track of which clients are currently available for tasks within a swarm.</p>
<a id="function-markoffline" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function markOffline<a href="#function-markoffline" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you tell the system that a particular client is no longer active within a specific group of agents.

Essentially, it's a way to keep track of which clients are currently online and participating.</p>
<a id="function-listeneventonce" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function listenEventOnce<a href="#function-listeneventonce" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you set up a temporary listener for events happening within the agent swarm. You specify which client you want to hear from (or listen to all clients), the event topic to watch for, and a filter to narrow down which events trigger your callback.</p>
<p>When an event arrives that matches your filter, the provided callback function is executed once with the event's data. The function automatically cleans up after itself, removing the listener after the first match. You can also stop listening earlier by using the unsubscribe function it returns. It makes sure you aren't trying to listen to any reserved event names.</p>
<a id="function-listenevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function listenEvent<a href="#function-listenevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you tune into specific messages being sent between agents in the swarm. You tell it which agent (or all agents) you want to listen to, and which type of message – we call that a “topic”. Whenever a message of that type is sent, a function you provide will be executed, receiving the message's content. Importantly, it returns a way to stop listening, ensuring you can clean up your listeners when they’re no longer needed.  You can listen to messages from all agents using a wildcard client ID.  It's designed to be reliable, ensuring messages are processed in order and protecting against reserved topic names.</p>
<a id="function-json" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function json<a href="#function-json" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function helps you get structured JSON data by following a defined outline – think of it like a recipe for how the data should be organized. You tell it the name of the outline you want to use, and optionally provide some input parameters to guide the data generation. To keep things running smoothly and avoid interference, it uses a special method that isolates each request. Essentially, it's a reliable way to get well-formatted data based on your specified outline.</p>
<a id="function-hassession" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function hasSession<a href="#function-hassession" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function helps you quickly determine if a client has an active session. It takes a client identifier as input and returns <code>true</code> if a session exists, and <code>false</code> otherwise. Behind the scenes, it uses a session validation service to do the actual check. If you’ve enabled logging, the function will also record that it was called.</p>
<a id="function-hasnavigation" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function hasNavigation<a href="#function-hasnavigation" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function helps you determine if an agent is actively guiding a client through a particular process. It verifies that the client and agent are valid, then looks at the agent swarm to see if the agent is included in the client's navigation path.

<ul>
<li><strong>Agent Creation &amp; Management:</strong> It creates and manages individual AI agent instances, ensuring their proper lifecycle.</li>
<li><strong>Efficient Reuse:</strong>  It cleverly caches AI agents, so it doesn't have to recreate them every time they are needed.</li>
<li><strong>Connecting the Pieces:</strong> It brings together different parts of the system (like logging, event handling, and data storage) to keep agents running smoothly.</li>
<li><strong>Workflow Control:</strong> It provides methods for controlling the agent's actions, like committing messages, requesting tools, and stopping actions. It allows the agent's workflow to be altered dynamically.</li>
<li><strong>Cleanup:</strong> When an agent is no longer needed, it makes sure resources are freed up and the system is clean.</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, this service is the engine that powers AI agent interactions, ensuring efficient use, proper handling, and coordinated operation within the swarm system.</p>

Think of it as the fundamental unit of communication between agents, tools, users, and the core system. It’s how information flows and how the system keeps track of what's happening.</p>
<p>Each message has a <code>role</code>, which tells you who or what sent it: a model (<code>assistant</code>), the system itself (<code>system</code>), a tool (<code>tool</code>), a user (<code>user</code>), a recovery process (<code>resque</code>), or a history reset (<code>flush</code>).  There's also an <code>agentName</code>, identifying the specific agent that sent the message, useful when dealing with multiple agents working together.  The <code>content</code> is the actual text or data being communicated.</p>
<p>The <code>mode</code> property clarifies whether the message originated from user input or a tool's action.  When a model needs to use a tool, the <code>tool_calls</code> array will contain details about that request.  <code>images</code> allows for the inclusion of image data.  <code>tool_call_id</code> links a tool's response back to its original request. Finally, <code>payload</code> provides a way to attach extra information to the message.</p>
<a id="interface-imethodcontext" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IMethodContext<a href="#interface-imethodcontext" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface, <code>IMethodContext</code>, acts as a central record for every time a method is called within the system. It bundles together key pieces of information about that specific call, like which client initiated it, what method was used, and which system components (agents, swarms, storage, compute, policies, and MCPs) were involved. Think of it as a way to track method executions across different parts of the system for things like performance monitoring, logging, and documentation. Each property provides a label identifying a specific resource related to the method call.</p>

Think of it as a way to store and retrieve the back-and-forth between an agent and a user.</p>
<p>You can add new messages to the history using the <code>push</code> method, specifying the message content, a client identifier, and the agent's name.  To retrieve the most recent message, use <code>pop</code>, which removes it from the history.  The <code>dispose</code> method allows you to clear the history for a specific client and agent when it's no longer needed. Finally, <code>iterate</code> provides a way to loop through all the messages recorded for a client and agent, enabling you to process or display the conversation flow.</p>
<a id="interface-ihistory" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IHistory<a href="#interface-ihistory" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface keeps track of all the messages exchanged with an AI model within a swarm. You can think of it as a memory for a specific agent or for raw model usage.</p>
<p>Adding a new message to the record is simple with the <code>push</code> method, and you can retrieve the most recent message with <code>pop</code>.</p>
<p>If you need to recreate a conversation for a specific agent, <code>toArrayForAgent</code> helps shape the history into a format suitable for that agent, potentially filtering or adjusting messages based on the context. If you just need all the raw messages as they were sent, <code>toArrayForRaw</code> provides that directly.</p>

Think of it as a central place to customize behaviors and ensure consistency across different parts of the system, like how agents handle tools, log messages, or recover from errors.</p>
<p>You can adjust these settings to fine-tune the system's behavior without modifying core code. For example, you can change how the system deals with tool call exceptions (&quot;flush&quot; the conversation or retry the tool call) or set up custom callbacks for agent changes or stack updates.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of what you can configure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Define how the system recovers from tool call errors (e.g., resetting the conversation or retrying).</li>
<li><strong>Logging:</strong> Control the level of detail in logging (debug, info, general, console).</li>
<li><strong>History Management:</strong> Limit the number of messages stored in the conversation history.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Usage:</strong> Set limits on how many tools an agent can use in a single run.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Behavior:</strong> Customize how agents map tools, validate outputs, and transform messages.</li>
<li><strong>Persistence:</strong>  Control how data, like agent states and embeddings, is stored.</li>
<li><strong>Operator Connections:</strong> Configure how operators interact with agents and receive messages.</li>
<li><strong>Navigation Stack:</strong> Define the default navigation stack used by agents.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Control banning of clients or implement security measures.</li>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Enable or disable embedding cache.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these settings have default values, but you can override them via the <code>setConfig</code> function to adapt the system to specific requirements. This allows you to modify the swarm’s behavior dynamically.</p>

You can specify custom messages to be sent when the system needs to clear buffers, when a tool generates output, or when an action is being executed. Importantly, you can include the user's last message in these custom messages, providing context and making the interactions feel more natural. The interface provides flexibility to define simple string messages or more complex functions that can dynamically generate messages based on the situation and agent involved.</p>

Think of it as a little packet of information that travels between different parts of the system – like the client interface, the performance monitoring tools, and the communication bus.</p>
<p>Each execution gets its own context, identified by a client ID, a unique execution ID, and a process ID. These IDs help pinpoint exactly which client started the process, what specific task is running, and which part of the system is responsible. It's like having a digital fingerprint for each activity.</p>

You can choose to save the system's internal state to a file for later use, and you’re required to give your embedding method a unique name.</p>
<p>The <code>writeEmbeddingCache</code> function lets you store computed embeddings so you don't have to recalculate them every time, and <code>readEmbeddingCache</code> lets you check if an embedding has already been computed. You can also customize how embeddings are created and compared using optional callbacks.</p>
<p>To create an embedding from some text, use the <code>createEmbedding</code> function. When you need to see how similar two pieces of text are, the <code>calculateSimilarity</code> function will give you a number representing their relatedness.</p>

Think of it as a blueprint for what a single, manageable unit of work looks like.</p>
<p>Each compute task has a descriptive name and a short explanation of what it does. You can also mark a task as &quot;shared&quot; if it's intended to be reused across multiple workflows.</p>
<p>Crucially, it specifies how to retrieve the data needed for the task (<code>getComputeData</code>), any dependencies on other tasks (<code>dependsOn</code>), and any middleware that should be applied to the process.</p>
<p>There’s also the option to define callbacks for handling different stages of the task’s execution, and a time-to-live (TTL) to manage its lifespan. Middleware functions allow you to customize the task’s behavior, offering flexibility and control.</p>
<a id="interface-icomputeparams" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IComputeParams<a href="#interface-icomputeparams" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>IComputeParams</code> interface defines the essential information needed for a compute task within the agent swarm orchestration framework. It acts as a container for key components – a unique <code>clientId</code> to identify the task, a <code>logger</code> for recording events and debugging, a <code>bus</code> for inter-agent communication, and a <code>binding</code> which specifies the state changes this compute task is responsible for. Think of it as a set of instructions and resources given to an agent to carry out a specific operation within the overall swarm's goals. It's how the framework passes along what an agent needs to know and use to successfully complete its job.</p>
<a id="interface-icomputemiddleware" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IComputeMiddleware<a href="#interface-icomputemiddleware" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the structure for middleware components that sit between the orchestration framework and the underlying AI agents. Think of it as a way to customize how requests are sent to and responses are received from your AI agents—perhaps to add logging, transform data, or implement rate limiting. Each middleware implementation needs to provide functions to handle the incoming request and outgoing response, allowing you to inject your own logic into the agent communication process. It's designed to be flexible, so you can tailor the interaction with each agent or group of agents to suit your specific needs.</p>
<a id="interface-icomputeconnectionservice" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IComputeConnectionService<a href="#interface-icomputeconnectionservice" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how your AI agents connect to and interact with compute resources, like servers or databases. Think of it as the bridge that allows your agents to actually <em>do</em> things in the world, instead of just thinking. It specifies the methods you'll need to implement to establish connections, execute commands, and retrieve results from these external systems. If you want your agents to, for example, fetch data from a database or run a script on a server, you're going to use this interface to make that possible. It ensures that all agents using the swarm framework interact with compute resources in a consistent and predictable way.</p>

Think of these callbacks as hooks that let you react to different stages of a compute unit's lifecycle.</p>
<p><code>onInit</code> is called when a compute unit is initialized, giving you a chance to perform any setup tasks.
<code>onDispose</code> signals that a compute unit is being shut down, allowing you to clean up resources or log information.
<code>onCompute</code> is triggered when the compute unit processes data, providing you with the processed data itself.
<code>onCalculate</code> lets you know when a specific state is being calculated within the compute unit.
Finally, <code>onUpdate</code> notifies you when a compute unit's state has been updated. By providing these callbacks, you can gain deeper insights into and influence the behavior of your agent swarm’s compute units.</p>
<a id="interface-icompute" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface ICompute<a href="#interface-icompute" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>ICompute</code> interface defines the core functions needed to manage computational tasks within the AI agent swarm. Think of it as a blueprint for components that perform calculations and update their status.</p>
<p>The <code>calculate</code> function is how these components actually do the work, taking a <code>stateName</code> to identify what needs to be computed. The <code>update</code> function allows you to report back on the progress or completion of a calculation, identifying both the component (<code>computeName</code>) and the client it belongs to. Finally, <code>getComputeData</code> is a simple way to retrieve information about the compute component’s current status and data.</p>

Think of it as a package containing all the details about a request – who’s asking (clientId and agentName), where the message came from (mode), the history of the conversation (messages), and any tools the agent can use (tools). It’s all about providing enough context for the system to understand the request and generate a relevant and useful response. Each request needs to include a client ID, agent name, execution mode, a list of messages for context, and optionally, a list of available tools.</p>

It provides a detailed breakdown of what’s happening within that client's interactions with the system.</p>
<p>You'd use this to understand how individual clients are performing – are some sessions consistently slower or using more memory than others?</p>
<p>Here's what information is tracked:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>clientId:</strong> A unique identifier for the client, so you can tie the performance data back to a specific session or agent.</li>
<li><strong>sessionMemory:</strong> Any data stored within the client's session. Think of it as temporary storage used during the client's activities.</li>
<li><strong>sessionState:</strong>  The client’s persistent state – things like its current step or configuration.</li>
<li><strong>executionCount:</strong>  How many operations (commands, tool calls) the client has performed.</li>
<li><strong>Input &amp; Output Sizes:</strong> Records the total and average sizes of data being sent to and from the client, giving you a sense of data volume.</li>

Think of it as a set of event listeners – you can register functions here to respond to things like when a chat session starts, a message is sent, or when an instance is ready or shutting down. You’ll receive details like the client ID, the swarm’s name, and sometimes the specific chat instance object itself, enabling you to track and react to changes in real-time. These callbacks help you build custom monitoring, logging, or even interactive elements around your agent swarm’s communication.</p>

It allows you to start a chat, send messages to it, and monitor its activity to ensure it remains responsive. You can initiate a new chat using <code>beginChat</code>, and then use <code>sendMessage</code> to communicate. The <code>checkLastActivity</code> method lets you verify if the chat is still active, while <code>dispose</code> gracefully shuts down the session when it’s no longer needed. If you want to be notified when a chat session is closed, you can register a listener with <code>listenDispose</code>.</p>

The <code>useChatAdapter</code> method lets you plug in a specific chat system – think of it as defining <em>how</em> your agents will communicate, whether that's through a standard chat window or a custom integration.</p>
<p>You can also customize how your chat instances behave using <code>useChatCallbacks</code>. This allows you to define functions that will be triggered by events within the chat, letting you tailor the experience and control the flow of information. Essentially, you’re setting up the specific actions that happen when certain things occur in the chat.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatargs" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatArgs<a href="#interface-ichatargs" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface, <code>IChatArgs</code>, defines the information needed to pass a message to an AI agent within the orchestration framework. It's essentially the data package for a single chat interaction. Each package requires a unique client identifier (<code>clientId</code>), specifies which agent is responsible for the conversation (<code>agentName</code>), and includes the actual message text (<code>message</code>) to be processed. Think of it as the envelope containing everything an agent needs to understand a new chat request.</p>

Think of it as a container for labels that help pinpoint <em>what</em> and <em>where</em> an event occurred.</p>
<p>For agents directly interacting with the system, like a ClientAgent, the <code>agentName</code> is the most commonly used field - it simply tells you which agent triggered the event.</p>
<p>However, the other fields – <code>swarmName</code>, <code>storageName</code>, <code>stateName</code>, <code>computeName</code>, and <code>policyName</code> – are available to provide context for system-level events, like those related to swarms, storage operations, state changes, computing tasks, or policy enforcement. Essentially, they add detail when an event isn't just about a single agent.</p>
<a id="interface-ibusevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBusEvent<a href="#interface-ibusevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the structure for messages sent across the system's internal communication channels. Think of it as a standard way for different parts of the system, especially agents, to talk to each other.</p>
<p>Each message will have a clear origin (source), a specific action it represents (type), and can carry data being sent or received (input and output). There’s also a way to attach extra information, like which agent is sending the message, to provide context. This standardized approach ensures consistent communication and helps orchestrate actions within the swarm.</p>
<a id="interface-ibus" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBus<a href="#interface-ibus" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>IBus</code> interface acts as a central communication hub within the system, allowing agents to send updates and information to specific clients. Think of it as a way for agents to broadcast messages – like &quot;I finished a task&quot; or &quot;Here's a new result&quot; – directly to the relevant client.</p>
<p>The key method, <code>emit</code>, sends these structured messages. When an agent needs to notify the system of something – perhaps a task completion, a tool's output, or a message commit – it uses <code>emit</code> to send a clearly defined event. This event includes details like the type of action, the origin of the message, any input data, results, and the client's ID.</p>
<p>Importantly, this communication is asynchronous, meaning the agent doesn't wait for the message to be received; it's placed in a queue and delivered later. The <code>clientId</code> within the event confirms the intended recipient, ensuring messages are delivered precisely. This promotes a loosely coupled architecture where agents and clients operate independently, with the bus facilitating communication between them. It's designed to provide reliable notifications and updates across the entire system, contributing to a shared understanding of what's happening.</p>
<a id="interface-ibaseevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBaseEvent<a href="#interface-ibaseevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface sets up the basic structure for all events happening within the agent swarm system. Every event, no matter its specific purpose, will have a <code>source</code> to tell you where it came from and a <code>clientId</code> to specify which client or agent instance it's meant for. Think of it as a common foundation that allows different parts of the system to communicate effectively by sending and receiving these standardized event messages. It makes sure the right information gets to the right place.</p>

Think of them as hooks you can use to observe and potentially influence what happens when a tool is used.</p>
<p>You can use <code>onBeforeCall</code> to perform actions right before a tool runs, like logging its intended use or preparing data.  <code>onAfterCall</code> lets you do things after the tool finishes, such as cleaning up resources or recording the results.</p>
<p><code>onValidate</code> gives you the power to check the tool’s input parameters before it even starts, ensuring everything is correct. And if something goes wrong, <code>onCallError</code> allows you to catch the error and handle it gracefully.</p>
<p>Essentially, these callbacks give you fine-grained control and insight into how your agent tools are operating.</p>
<a id="interface-iagenttool" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentTool<a href="#interface-iagenttool" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface describes a tool that an AI agent can use within a swarm. Each tool has a name, a description for documentation, and a way to validate the input it receives before running.</p>
<p>You can also add custom logic to control what happens before and after the tool is executed. The <code>validate</code> property lets you check if the tool’s input is correct. The <code>call</code> method is how you actually run the tool, passing in all the necessary information about the request and the agent using it. Finally, there's a way to dynamically define the tool’s metadata, useful for complex scenarios.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemainternalcallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaInternalCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagentschemainternalcallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you plug in custom actions that happen at different points in an agent's lifecycle. Think of them as hooks – you can define functions to be run when the agent starts, produces output, uses a tool, encounters an error, or completes a sequence of actions. These callbacks allow you to monitor agent behavior, log events, or even intervene in the agent's process at various stages like when a tool is requested or when the agent needs to be restarted. You can also get notified when the agent's memory is cleared or when it's being shut down.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemainternal" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaInternal<a href="#interface-iagentschemainternal" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how an agent is configured within the swarm. It outlines all the settings that control an agent's behavior, from its name and primary instructions to the tools it can use and how it interacts with other agents.</p>
<p>You can set things like the maximum number of tool calls, how much conversation history the agent remembers, and provide descriptions for documentation. The <code>prompt</code> property dictates the agent's core instructions, and <code>system</code> prompts are used for more complex protocols like tool usage.</p>
<p>There are also options for connecting to an operator dashboard, defining dependencies on other agents, and transforming the model’s output.  Finally, you can customize the agent's lifecycle with optional callbacks for finer-grained control.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemacallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagentschemacallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you listen in on different points in an agent's lifecycle. You can use these callbacks to monitor what's happening, log actions, or even influence the agent's behavior at specific moments. For example, you can get notified when the agent starts running, when a tool generates output, or when it's being reset. These hooks provide a way to extend and customize the agent orchestration framework without directly modifying its core functionality. You’re able to track things like tool requests, user messages, and system notifications to gain a deeper understanding of how the agent is operating.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschema" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchema<a href="#interface-iagentschema" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface, <code>IAgentSchema</code>, describes the configuration for an AI agent within a swarm orchestration framework. It allows you to define how an agent should behave, primarily through system prompts.</p>
<p>You can set a <code>system</code> prompt – or multiple prompts in an array – to guide the agent's actions and responses, often used when agents need to use tools. <code>systemStatic</code> serves as an alternative name for the same purpose.</p>
<p>For more advanced control, <code>systemDynamic</code> lets you create system prompts on the fly. This dynamic approach uses a function that generates the prompt based on information like the client ID and agent name, providing greater flexibility and context-awareness.</p>

Think of it as a collection of essential components that allow the agent to operate effectively.</p>
<p>It includes things like a client ID to identify the user or system interacting with the agent, a logger for recording what the agent does, and a communication bus for coordinating with other agents.</p>
<p>The agent also gets access to tools it can use to perform tasks, a history tracker to remember previous interactions, and a completion mechanism for generating results. Finally, you can provide a validation function to ensure the agent's output is correct and safe.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentnavigationparams" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentNavigationParams<a href="#interface-iagentnavigationparams" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how you set up navigation for your AI agents. Think of it as providing instructions on where an agent should go and what it will do when it gets there. You specify the tool's name and a short description of its purpose. Crucially, you tell the framework which agent the tool should navigate to.  You can also add an optional note to provide more details about the tool's behavior.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentconnectionservice" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentConnectionService<a href="#interface-iagentconnectionservice" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface helps define how different agents connect and communicate within the system. Think of it as a blueprint for building reliable connections between agents. It’s designed to make sure the public-facing parts of the agent connection service are clear and consistent, hiding the internal workings. By using this interface, developers can ensure their agent connections adhere to a standard and function correctly.</p>
<a id="interface-iagent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgent<a href="#interface-iagent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how you interact with an individual agent within your swarm. Think of it as the blueprint for each agent's behavior.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>run</code> method for quick, isolated tasks or previews without affecting the agent's memory. The <code>execute</code> method is the main way to make the agent work, potentially updating its history depending on the execution mode you choose.</p>
<p>The <code>waitForOutput</code> method lets you grab the final result the agent produces.</p>
<p>Beyond that, you have several ways to manage the agent's internal workings: <code>commitToolOutput</code> lets you add tool responses, <code>commitSystemMessage</code> handles system-level instructions, and <code>commitUserMessage</code> allows adding user input without generating a reply.</p>
<p>You can also control the flow with methods like <code>commitToolRequest</code> (to send tool requests), <code>commitAssistantMessage</code> (to add assistant replies), <code>commitFlush</code> (to clear the agent’s memory), and <code>commitStopTools</code> (to halt tool execution). Finally, <code>commitAgentChange</code>, <code>commitCancelOutput</code> provide mechanisms to interrupt or reset agent processes.</p>
