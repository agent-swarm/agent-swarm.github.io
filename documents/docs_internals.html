<p><strong>Overall Architecture:</strong></p>
<p>This system built around a distributed, asynchronous architecture. Agents communicate via a message queue, and their interactions are orchestrated through a series of tools and processes. The core concept is to allow agents to perform tasks independently while still being part of a larger, coordinated system.</p>
<p><strong>Core Concepts &amp; Relationships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swarm Orchestration:</strong> The entire framework is built around orchestrating agents to perform tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Agent as the Central Unit:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> is the fundamental building block – the individual agent that executes tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Communication (Bus):</strong> The <code>IAgentParams</code> interface highlights the importance of the <code>bus</code> (a messaging system) for agents to communicate and coordinate.</li>
<li><strong>History Management:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> and <code>IAgentParams</code> emphasize the agent's ability to operate without relying on conversation history (using the <code>run</code> method).</li>
<li><strong>Tool Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>call</code> and <code>execute</code> methods are central to running tools within the agent.</li>
<li><strong>Schema &amp; Configuration:</strong> The <code>IAgentSchema</code> defines the configuration for each agent, including its tools, prompt, and completion mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interface Breakdown &amp; Key Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a summary of each interface and its role:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>IAgent</code>:</strong> The core runtime agent.  Handles independent execution, tool calls, message commitment, and lifecycle management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentParams</code>:</strong>  Provides the agent with the necessary parameters for operation, including its ID, logging, communication channel, and history management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchema</code>:</strong> Defines the configuration settings for an agent (tools, prompt, completion mechanism).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchemaCallbacks</code>:</strong>  Provides callbacks for managing different stages of an agent’s lifecycle (init, run, output, etc.).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentConnectionService</code>:</strong> A type definition for an <code>AgentConnectionService</code> – a service that manages connections between the agents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Workflow Implications</strong></p>
<p>Based on these interfaces, here’s a workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Agent Configuration:</strong> An <code>IAgentSchema</code> is created to define the agent’s settings.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Instantiation:</strong> An <code>IAgent</code> instance is created based on the schema.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>execute</code> method is called to initiate independent operation.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Calls:</strong>  The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>call</code> to execute tools.</li>
<li><strong>Message Handling:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>commitToolOutput</code>, <code>commitSystemMessage</code>, and <code>commitUserMessage</code> to manage messages.</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses the <code>bus</code> (via <code>IAgentParams</code>) to communicate with other agents.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key Concepts &amp; Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> Agents maintain their own state (conversation history, tool outputs, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Decoupling:</strong> The interfaces are designed to decouple different components of the system. This allows for flexibility and easier maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Event-Driven Architecture:</strong> The use of callbacks suggests an event-driven architecture, where components communicate through events rather than direct calls.</li>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> The interfaces highlight the importance of managing the agent's state, including conversation history, tool output, and system messages.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Integration:</strong> The <code>tools</code> property in <code>IAgentParams</code> indicates a system designed to integrate with external tools.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous Communication:</strong> Agents communicate asynchronously via a bus, allowing them to operate independently.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The system is designed to be flexible, a</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Use Cases:</strong></p>
<p>This architecture could be used for a wide range of applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chatbots:</strong>  Agents could be used to power conversational AI systems.</li>
<li><strong>Content Generation:</strong> Agents could be used to generate text, images, or other content.</li>
<li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Agents could be used to analyze data and generate insights.</li>
</ul>

Think of it as telling the system, &quot;Hey, I want this particular sequence of tasks to run.&quot; You'll need to specify a unique client identifier, the name of the pipeline you want to execute, and the agent responsible for handling it. You can also include data, called a payload, to give the pipeline some initial information it needs to work with. The function will then return a result, which will tell you how the pipeline ran.</p>
<a id="function-scope" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function scope<a href="#function-scope" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you run a piece of code – like a task or a small process – within a defined environment that manages things like AI agents and how they interact. You provide the code you want to run, and optionally, you can tweak the underlying tools and services it uses. Think of it as setting up a temporary workspace for your code with pre-configured resources. This allows for controlled execution and potential overrides for experimentation or specific needs. The function returns a promise that resolves with the result of your code, or nothing if the code doesn’t return a value.</p>
<a id="function-runstatelessforce" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function runStatelessForce<a href="#function-runstatelessforce" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you quickly run a command or message through your AI agent swarm without adding it to the ongoing conversation history. Think of it as a way to execute a task independently, useful for things like processing storage output or handling one-off jobs.</p>
<p>It guarantees the task will run, even if the agent currently in charge has changed or isn’t actively responding. You provide the content you want executed and a unique identifier for the client making the request. The system handles the technical details, including validating the setup, tracking performance, and ensuring a fresh environment for the agent to work in.</p>
<a id="function-runstateless" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function runStateless<a href="#function-runstateless" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you quickly run a task or instruction with a specific agent in your swarm without adding it to the ongoing conversation history. It’s useful when you need to process something like data from a storage system or handle a single, isolated task.</p>
<p>Essentially, it sends a message to the designated agent and gets a response, all while making sure the agent is still available and the process is tracked for performance. The function ensures a fresh start for the agent each time, preventing any interference from previous interactions.</p>
<p>You provide the message content, a client identifier, and the name of the agent you want to use. The function then takes care of the rest, handling agent validation, execution, and metadata tracking.</p>
<a id="function-questionforce" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function questionForce<a href="#function-questionforce" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you directly trigger a question-answering process, even if it doesn't naturally arise from a conversation. Think of it as a way to force the AI swarm to focus on a specific question or piece of information. You provide the question itself, a unique identifier for the system using the function (the <code>clientId</code>), and the name of the knowledge base (the <code>wikiName</code>) that the AI should draw information from. The function will then return the AI's response to the forced question.</p>
<p>It’s useful when you need to ensure a particular topic is addressed or to directly test the AI’s understanding of a specific area.</p>
<a id="function-question" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function question<a href="#function-question" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you send a question to your AI agent swarm. It takes the actual question you want answered, a unique identifier for who's asking, the name of the agent responsible for handling the question, and the name of the knowledge source (like a wiki) the agent should use. The function then returns a promise that resolves to the agent's answer. Think of it as the main way to get answers from your AI agents.</p>
<p>It's designed to be a simple and clear way to interact with your AI agents and get them working together to provide information.</p>
<a id="function-overridewiki" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideWiki<a href="#function-overridewiki" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you change the settings of a wiki within the swarm. Think of it as updating a wiki’s blueprint.</p>
<p>You provide a new or modified version of the wiki's configuration, and this function applies those changes.</p>
<p>It makes these changes independently, ensuring a controlled update process. The system also keeps a record of the change if logging is turned on. You can specify just parts of the wiki's schema – you don't have to redefine everything.</p>
<a id="function-overridetool" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideTool<a href="#function-overridetool" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you change how a tool behaves within the AI agent swarm. Think of it as modifying a tool's instructions or capabilities. You can update existing tools with new information or adjust their settings. This change happens independently, ensuring a clean and isolated update process. The system will also record this modification if you've enabled logging. You provide the updated tool information, and the framework takes care of applying those changes.</p>
<a id="function-overrideswarm" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideSwarm<a href="#function-overrideswarm" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you change the setup of a swarm, essentially modifying its configuration. You can provide a new schema or just a few updates to the existing one. Think of it as a way to adjust how your swarm operates without affecting other processes. It makes the change directly, creating a fresh environment for the update to happen cleanly, and will log the action if you've configured logging to be on. You provide the new or modified schema as input to this function.</p>
<a id="function-overridestorage" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideStorage<a href="#function-overridestorage" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you modify how data is stored within the AI agent swarm. Think of it as a way to adjust the rules for a specific storage system – perhaps changing how much data it holds or how it's organized. You provide a new or partial set of rules (the <code>storageSchema</code>), and the system updates the existing storage configuration accordingly. This is done independently to keep things clean and safe, and the system will record the change if you’ve enabled logging. You can use it to tweak storage settings without affecting ongoing operations.</p>
<a id="function-overridestate" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideState<a href="#function-overridestate" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you change how a specific state within the swarm operates. Think of it as directly modifying a state's blueprint. You can update existing parts of the state or add new ones, essentially customizing its behavior. This change happens independently, without affecting anything else that's currently running, guaranteeing a controlled modification.  If you have logging turned on, the system will record that this override happened. You provide the new or updated state definition as an argument to this function.</p>
<a id="function-overridepolicy" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overridePolicy<a href="#function-overridepolicy" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you modify a policy's settings within the agent swarm. Think of it as a way to adjust how a specific policy behaves, either by completely replacing its definition or just tweaking certain aspects. The change is made directly, without affecting any ongoing processes, ensuring a controlled update.  If logging is turned on, the system will record that this policy override happened. You provide a partial definition of the policy you want to change, and the function applies those changes.</p>
<a id="function-overridepipeline" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overridePipeline<a href="#function-overridepipeline" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you modify an existing pipeline definition, allowing you to make adjustments without rebuilding the entire thing from scratch. Think of it as a way to fine-tune a workflow. You provide a partial pipeline definition – just the changes you want to make – and this function merges them with the original pipeline. It’s really helpful for adapting your workflows to different situations or experimenting with slight variations. The resulting schema will be a combination of the original and your provided updates.</p>
<a id="function-overridemcp" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideMCP<a href="#function-overridemcp" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you adjust and replace parts of an existing Model Context Protocol (MCP) schema. Think of it as a way to fine-tune how your AI agents understand and share information. You provide a new schema, and this function will merge it with the original, effectively updating the existing one. It’s useful when you need to change or add details to how agents communicate. The schema you give it acts as the instructions for those modifications.</p>
<a id="function-overrideembeding" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideEmbeding<a href="#function-overrideembeding" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you change how your AI agents understand and process information by adjusting the embedding schema. Think of it as tweaking the way agents convert text into numerical representations. You can provide a complete new schema or just some updates to an existing one. This change happens independently, ensuring a clean and isolated process. The system will record this alteration if logging is turned on.</p>
<a id="function-overridecompute" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideCompute<a href="#function-overridecompute" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you tweak existing compute schemas – think of them as blueprints for how tasks get processed – by providing updates. It’s a way to modify a schema without having to define the entire thing from scratch. You simply provide the parts you want to change, and this function merges them into the original schema. This is useful when you need to adapt a standard processing setup to a specific situation. The <code>computeSchema</code> parameter holds these updates you’re providing.</p>
<a id="function-overridecompletion" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideCompletion<a href="#function-overridecompletion" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you change how the swarm generates responses. Think of it as modifying a blueprint for creating text.</p>
<p>You can use it to adjust specific parts of that blueprint, like altering the way it formats the output or changes the style of language it uses.</p>
<p>It operates independently, so changes are isolated and don't affect ongoing processes.</p>
<p>If the system is set up to log actions, this override will be recorded. You provide a partial schema, and it merges with the existing one.</p>
<a id="function-overrideagent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function overrideAgent<a href="#function-overrideagent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you change the configuration of an agent already running within the swarm. Think of it as a way to tweak an agent's settings on the fly. You can provide a new schema or just a few specific updates. It's designed to work independently, making sure the changes are isolated and don't interfere with anything else happening in the swarm. The system will also record these adjustments if logging is turned on. You provide the new or updated agent configuration as input.</p>
<a id="function-notifyforce" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function notifyForce<a href="#function-notifyforce" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you push a message out to the swarm as a notification, essentially like a broadcast. Think of it as a way to communicate directly with the agents without them needing to process a regular incoming message.</p>
<p>It’s specifically intended for sessions created using the &quot;makeConnection&quot; setup. Before sending, it checks to make sure everything is still working correctly – the session, the swarm, and the agent you've targeted.</p>
<p>You provide the message content and a client ID to identify where the notification is coming from. The system ensures a fresh environment and logs the action for transparency, but will raise an error if used outside of a &quot;makeConnection&quot; session.</p>
<a id="function-notify" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function notify<a href="#function-notify" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you send messages out of your AI agent swarm without triggering any further processing within the system. Think of it as a way to broadcast information directly from a specific agent.</p>
<p>It’s specifically intended for situations where you’re establishing a direct connection with the swarm. Before sending, the system verifies that the agent you're sending from is still available and hasn't been replaced.</p>
<p>You’ll need to provide the message content, a unique identifier for the client sending the message, and the name of the agent responsible for sending the notification.</p>
<a id="function-markonline" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function markOnline<a href="#function-markonline" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you tell the system that a particular client is now active within a specific group of agents. Think of it as a simple &quot;hello, I'm online!&quot; signal. You provide the unique ID of the client and the name of the swarm (or group) they belong to, and the system updates its records accordingly. It’s a straightforward way to keep track of which agents are participating. The function doesn’t return any data; it just confirms the status update.</p>
<a id="function-markoffline" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function markOffline<a href="#function-markoffline" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you tell the system that a particular client, identified by its unique ID, is no longer active within a specific swarm. Think of it as updating the system's knowledge about which agents are currently participating. You provide the client's ID and the name of the swarm it’s part of, and the function handles the internal process of marking that client as offline. This is useful for managing the agent population and ensuring tasks are assigned to available agents.</p>
<a id="function-listeneventonce" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function listenEventOnce<a href="#function-listeneventonce" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you listen for a specific event from one or all clients within the swarm, but only once. You tell it which client you're interested in (or use &quot;*&quot; to hear from everyone), the name of the event you're waiting for, and a filter to make sure you only get the events you care about. When an event matching your criteria arrives, a provided callback function gets executed with the event's data. Importantly, this listener automatically stops after it has heard the first matching event. You’re also given a way to cancel the listener early if needed. The function makes sure you don’t try to listen to events from special, reserved names.</p>
<a id="function-listenevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function listenEvent<a href="#function-listenevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you tune in to messages being sent across your agent swarm. You specify a client ID – which can be a specific client or use a wildcard to hear from everyone – and a topic name to listen for. When a message with that topic is sent, a callback function you provide will be triggered, receiving the message’s contents. The function provides a way to easily stop listening later by returning an unsubscribe function. There are some topic names that are reserved and can’t be used.</p>
<a id="function-hassession" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function hasSession<a href="#function-hassession" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function helps you quickly determine if an active session already exists for a particular client. It simply checks if a session is currently associated with the provided client ID. Behind the scenes, it uses a session validation service to perform this check. If logging is turned on, the function will record that it was called. You pass in the client's unique ID, and it returns true if a session is found, and false otherwise.</p>
<a id="function-hasnavigation" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function hasNavigation<a href="#function-hasnavigation" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function helps you determine if a particular agent is involved in guiding a client through a specific process. It essentially checks if an agent is part of the planned sequence for a client's journey.</p>
<p>To use it, you’ll need to provide the unique identifier for the client and the name of the agent you want to check. The function then verifies that both the client and agent are valid and looks at the overall navigation plan to see if the agent is included.</p>
<p>It's designed to be transparent, so if logging is turned on, it will record these checks for monitoring purposes.</p>
<a id="function-getuserhistory" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function getUserHistory<a href="#function-getuserhistory" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function helps you get a list of messages a user has sent during a specific session. You provide the unique identifier for that session, and it returns an array of messages where the user was the one sending them.

It’s designed to manage agent transitions for client sessions, ensuring a smooth experience.</p>
<p>Essentially, it moves a client's active agent one step back in their session history, or to the default, making sure the change is valid and logged appropriately. The system handles this change carefully, putting it in a queue and limiting its execution time. It ensures this switch happens independently of any ongoing processes.</p>
<p>You're required to provide the unique identifier of the client session when using this function.</p>
<a id="function-changetodefaultagent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function changeToDefaultAgent<a href="#function-changetodefaultagent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function helps bring a client back to using the standard, pre-configured agent within the AI agent swarm. Think of it as a reset button for a client's agent selection. It takes a unique identifier for the client's session and safely switches them back to the default agent. The system verifies everything is set up correctly, keeps a record of the change if logging is turned on, and handles the switch in a controlled way to avoid any conflicts. This ensures a smooth transition back to the baseline agent for that client.</p>
<a id="function-changetoagent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Function changeToAgent<a href="#function-changetoagent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This function lets you switch which AI agent is handling a client's session within your swarm. It's designed to safely and reliably change agents, making sure everything is set up correctly and logged appropriately. Think of it as a way to reassign a client interaction to a different agent, ensuring a smooth handover. You specify the name of the new agent and the client's unique ID to make the switch happen.

Think of it as a package containing everything the AI agent needs to understand what you're asking and provide a helpful answer.</p>
<p>It includes details like which client is making the request, the name of the agent involved, and the execution mode – whether the previous message came from a tool or directly from a user.</p>
<p>Crucially, it contains the conversation history – the “messages” – so the AI has context. It also allows you to specify any available tools the agent might use to fulfill the request.</p>
<a id="interface-icompletion" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface ICompletion<a href="#interface-icompletion" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how your AI agents can get responses from language models. Think of it as the standard way agents request and receive information. It builds upon a basic completion format, adding all the necessary pieces to make the process work smoothly, giving you a full set of tools to manage those responses.</p>
<a id="interface-iclientperfomancerecord" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IClientPerfomanceRecord<a href="#interface-iclientperfomancerecord" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface describes the performance data collected for each individual client, like a user session or agent instance, as part of a larger process. It breaks down the overall process performance into smaller, manageable chunks tied to specific clients.</p>
<p>Each client's record includes things like its unique identifier (<code>clientId</code>), any data stored during its session (<code>sessionMemory</code> and <code>sessionState</code>), and detailed metrics about its executions – how many times it ran tasks (<code>executionCount</code>), how much data it processed (<code>executionInputTotal</code>, <code>executionOutputTotal</code>), and how long each execution took (<code>executionTimeTotal</code>, <code>executionTimeAverage</code>).  These properties help you understand how each client contributes to the overall system performance and identify any bottlenecks or inefficiencies related to specific clients.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatinstancecallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatInstanceCallbacks<a href="#interface-ichatinstancecallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines a set of callbacks you can use to be notified about what’s happening with a chat instance within your agent swarm. You'll receive notifications when an instance is first set up (<code>onInit</code>), when it's finished and cleaned up (<code>onDispose</code>), and when a chat session actually starts (<code>onBeginChat</code>). You're also alerted whenever a message is sent from the chat instance (<code>onSendMessage</code>). Finally, <code>onCheckActivity</code> lets you know if an instance is still active and when it last performed an action. This allows you to monitor and react to the lifecycle and interactions of your AI agents.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatinstance" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatInstance<a href="#interface-ichatinstance" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface represents a single chat session within your AI agent swarm. Think of it as a dedicated space where agents can communicate.</p>
<p>The <code>beginChat</code> method starts a new conversation. To keep things running smoothly, <code>checkLastActivity</code> periodically verifies if the chat is still active.  If an agent needs to send a message, use <code>sendMessage</code>, which returns the response. When you're done with a chat, <code>dispose</code> cleans up the resources. Finally, <code>listenDispose</code> allows you to be notified when a chat session is being closed.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatcontrol" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatControl<a href="#interface-ichatcontrol" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface, <code>IChatControl</code>, lets you configure how your AI agent swarm interacts with chat systems. Think of it as a way to plug in different chat technologies or customize the way messages are handled.</p>
<p>You can use <code>useChatAdapter</code> to specify which chat system your agents will use – essentially telling the framework which &quot;language&quot; your agents speak.  Then, <code>useChatCallbacks</code> lets you fine-tune the behavior, allowing you to react to specific events within the chat process, such as when a message is received or sent.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatargs" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatArgs<a href="#interface-ichatargs" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>IChatArgs</code> interface defines the data needed to initiate a chat interaction with an agent within the system. Think of it as a standardized way to pass information about a conversation. It requires a unique <code>clientId</code> to identify where the chat is coming from, a specific <code>agentName</code> to direct the chat to the correct agent, and the actual <code>message</code> content that you want the agent to process. This helps ensure consistent and reliable communication between clients and the agent swarm.</p>
<a id="interface-ibuseventcontext" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBusEventContext<a href="#interface-ibuseventcontext" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface helps give events extra information about what’s happening in the system. Think of it as a way to add details to events so you know which agent, swarm, storage, state, compute, or policy is involved. When an agent is sending an event, it will usually just include the agent's name. Other parts of the system might use this to add details about swarms, storage, states, computes, or policies when an event occurs. It's like adding labels to events to make them more informative.</p>
<a id="interface-ibusevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBusEvent<a href="#interface-ibusevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface describes a standardized way for different parts of the system to communicate, especially within agents. Think of it as a structured message that agents can send to each other to share information about what they're doing, the results they’re seeing, or changes in state.</p>
<p>Each message includes information about where it's coming from (identified as &quot;agent-bus&quot; for agent communication), what kind of action it represents (like &quot;run&quot; or &quot;commit-user-message&quot;), and any relevant data being passed along. This data is split into input (what triggered the event) and output (the result of the action).  Finally, there’s a context section which usually tells us which agent is sending the message.  This consistent format helps the system reliably understand and react to events happening within the agent swarm.</p>
<a id="interface-ibus" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBus<a href="#interface-ibus" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>IBus</code> interface acts as a central communication channel within the swarm system, enabling agents to share information with specific clients. Think of it as a way for agents to broadcast updates and results, like notifying a client when a message is processed or a tool completes its work.</p>
<p>The core functionality is the <code>emit</code> method. This method allows agents to send structured events to a designated client, ensuring that information is delivered precisely where it's needed.  Each event follows a standard format and includes details like the event type, the agent that sent it, any relevant input or output data, and the target client ID.</p>
<p>This system uses asynchronous delivery, so the <code>emit</code> method returns a promise, indicating the event is queued for delivery. The client ID is repeated within the event itself, providing an extra layer of clarity and validation.  Essentially, it’s a well-defined and type-safe way for agents to keep clients informed about what’s happening in the swarm.</p>
<a id="interface-ibaseevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBaseEvent<a href="#interface-ibaseevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lays out the basic structure for any event happening within the system, like an agent sending a message or a session updating. Every event will have a <code>source</code> indicating where it came from – whether it's a custom component or a specific agent bus.  Every event also includes a <code>clientId</code> to ensure it reaches the right client or agent instance, acting like an address for the message. Think of it as the foundation upon which more detailed event types are built.</p>
<a id="interface-iagenttoolcallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentToolCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagenttoolcallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface provides a way to connect to and observe the lifecycle of individual tools used by your AI agents. Think of it as a set of hooks you can use to plug in custom logic at different points – before a tool runs, after it finishes, when you need to check if the tool's inputs are valid, or when something goes wrong.</p>
<p>You can use <code>onBeforeCall</code> to prepare before a tool is run, for example to log what’s happening or adjust parameters. <code>onAfterCall</code> lets you perform actions after the tool completes, such as saving results or cleaning up resources.  <code>onValidate</code> allows you to define your own rules to make sure the inputs to a tool are correct before it even starts. And finally, <code>onCallError</code> helps you to handle and log any errors that might occur during the tool's execution.</p>
<a id="interface-iagenttool" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentTool<a href="#interface-iagenttool" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface describes a tool that an agent in the swarm can use. Each tool has a name to identify it and a description that helps users understand how to use it.</p>
<p>Before a tool is used, a validation step checks if the provided parameters are correct. This check can happen quickly or might require some more complex processing.</p>
<p>You can also add callbacks to customize how the tool behaves at different stages of its lifecycle.</p>
<p>The tool’s functionality itself is defined through a <code>function</code> property, which might provide metadata about the function or directly define the function’s execution logic.</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>call</code> method is used to actually run the tool, providing it with the necessary information about the client, agent, and context.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemainternalcallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaInternalCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagentschemainternalcallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface provides a way to hook into different stages of an agent's lifecycle, allowing you to react to what the agent is doing. You can define functions to be called when the agent starts running, when it uses a tool, when it generates a system message, or when its memory is cleared. These callbacks provide opportunities to log events, monitor progress, or modify the agent’s behavior as it operates. Essentially, it’s a way to customize and observe an agent’s activity at key moments, from its initial setup to when it’s finished running.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemainternal" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaInternal<a href="#interface-iagentschemainternal" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how an agent is configured within the system. It outlines the agent's name, the prompt it uses, and the tools and data sources it has access to. You can provide a description for documentation purposes, limit the number of tool calls or messages to manage context, and even set up dynamic system prompts that change based on the client or agent.</p>
<p>The configuration also allows for defining connections to operator dashboards, validating the agent's responses, transforming outputs, and customizing message mapping. Finally, you can specify dependencies on other agents within the swarm and register lifecycle callbacks for finer control over the agent's behavior.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemacallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagentschemacallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you tap into the key moments of an agent's lifecycle. Think of it as a way to listen in on what's happening as the agent works – whether it's starting up, processing requests, generating output, or recovering from interruptions.</p>
<p>You can register functions to be notified when an agent begins running, when it requests tools, when it generates system messages, or when it completes a sequence of tool calls. There are also callbacks for specific events like when an agent is initialized, when its history is cleared, or when it's fully shut down. It's a flexible way to monitor and potentially influence the agent’s behavior without directly modifying its core logic.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschema" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchema<a href="#interface-iagentschema" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface, <code>IAgentSchema</code>, defines the structure for configuring an agent within the orchestration framework. It focuses on providing the agent with initial instructions and context.</p>
<p>You can set a static <code>system</code> prompt, or an array of prompts, to guide the agent's behavior – think of this as the agent's foundational instructions.  <code>systemStatic</code> is simply another way to specify the same thing.</p>
<p>For more personalized or changing instructions, you can use <code>systemDynamic</code>. This allows you to generate prompts based on the agent's client ID and name, making it possible to tailor instructions for specific situations. The prompt generation is handled by a function that can return either a single string or an array of strings.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentparams" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentParams<a href="#interface-iagentparams" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the information passed to each agent when it runs. Think of it as a set of instructions and resources the agent needs to do its job.</p>
<p>It includes things like a unique identifier for who’s using the agent (clientId), a way to record what the agent is doing (logger), a system for communicating with other agents (bus), and access to external tools (mcp).</p>
<p>Agents also get a memory of past interactions (history) and a way to create final responses (completion).</p>
<p>You can optionally provide tools for the agent to use, and even a way to check if the agent’s output is correct before it's finalized (validate).</p>
<a id="interface-iagentnavigationparams" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentNavigationParams<a href="#interface-iagentnavigationparams" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how to set up navigation instructions for your AI agents. It lets you specify the tool's name and a description of what it does, along with the agent you want it to navigate to. You can also add a helpful note for documentation and, if needed, tell the system to skip certain outputs when multiple navigation options are available. Essentially, it's a way to clearly communicate where an agent should go and what it's supposed to do once it gets there.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentconnectionservice" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentConnectionService<a href="#interface-iagentconnectionservice" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface helps define how different agents connect and communicate within the system. Think of it as a blueprint for creating reliable connections between agents. It’s designed to clearly outline the public-facing capabilities related to agent connections, leaving out the internal workings. By using this interface, we ensure that services interacting with the agent swarm have a consistent and predictable way to manage agent connections.</p>
<a id="interface-iagent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgent<a href="#interface-iagent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>IAgent</code> interface describes how an AI agent behaves and interacts during its operation. It defines core actions like running the agent for quick tests without affecting its memory, or executing it fully to update its history.</p>
<p>You can use methods like <code>run</code> for one-off tasks, while <code>execute</code> handles the agent's regular processing.  <code>waitForOutput</code> lets you specifically wait for the agent to finish its work.</p>
<p>The interface also includes ways to manage the agent’s context, allowing you to add messages – whether system instructions, user prompts, or tool responses – and clear its memory when needed. You can even control the flow of tool calls, stopping them or canceling ongoing operations. These methods give you fine-grained control over the agent’s lifecycle and behavior.</p>
