<p><strong>Overall Architecture:</strong></p>
<p>This system built around a distributed, asynchronous architecture. Agents communicate via a message queue, and their interactions are orchestrated through a series of tools and processes. The core concept is to allow agents to perform tasks independently while still being part of a larger, coordinated system.</p>
<p><strong>Core Concepts &amp; Relationships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swarm Orchestration:</strong> The entire framework is built around orchestrating agents to perform tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Agent as the Central Unit:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> is the fundamental building block – the individual agent that executes tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Communication (Bus):</strong> The <code>IAgentParams</code> interface highlights the importance of the <code>bus</code> (a messaging system) for agents to communicate and coordinate.</li>
<li><strong>History Management:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> and <code>IAgentParams</code> emphasize the agent's ability to operate without relying on conversation history (using the <code>run</code> method).</li>
<li><strong>Tool Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>call</code> and <code>execute</code> methods are central to running tools within the agent.</li>
<li><strong>Schema &amp; Configuration:</strong> The <code>IAgentSchema</code> defines the configuration for each agent, including its tools, prompt, and completion mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interface Breakdown &amp; Key Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a summary of each interface and its role:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>IAgent</code>:</strong> The core runtime agent.  Handles independent execution, tool calls, message commitment, and lifecycle management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentParams</code>:</strong>  Provides the agent with the necessary parameters for operation, including its ID, logging, communication channel, and history management.</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchema</code>:</strong> Defines the configuration settings for an agent (tools, prompt, completion mechanism).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentSchemaCallbacks</code>:</strong>  Provides callbacks for managing different stages of an agent’s lifecycle (init, run, output, etc.).</li>
<li><strong><code>IAgentConnectionService</code>:</strong> A type definition for an <code>AgentConnectionService</code> – a service that manages connections between the agents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Workflow Implications</strong></p>
<p>Based on these interfaces, here’s a workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Agent Configuration:</strong> An <code>IAgentSchema</code> is created to define the agent’s settings.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Instantiation:</strong> An <code>IAgent</code> instance is created based on the schema.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Execution:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code>’s <code>execute</code> method is called to initiate independent operation.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Calls:</strong>  The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>call</code> to execute tools.</li>
<li><strong>Message Handling:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses <code>commitToolOutput</code>, <code>commitSystemMessage</code>, and <code>commitUserMessage</code> to manage messages.</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> The <code>IAgent</code> uses the <code>bus</code> (via <code>IAgentParams</code>) to communicate with other agents.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key Concepts &amp; Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> Agents maintain their own state (conversation history, tool outputs, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Decoupling:</strong> The interfaces are designed to decouple different components of the system. This allows for flexibility and easier maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Event-Driven Architecture:</strong> The use of callbacks suggests an event-driven architecture, where components communicate through events rather than direct calls.</li>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> The interfaces highlight the importance of managing the agent's state, including conversation history, tool output, and system messages.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Integration:</strong> The <code>tools</code> property in <code>IAgentParams</code> indicates a system designed to integrate with external tools.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous Communication:</strong> Agents communicate asynchronously via a bus, allowing them to operate independently.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The system is designed to be flexible, a</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Use Cases:</strong></p>
<p>This architecture could be used for a wide range of applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chatbots:</strong>  Agents could be used to power conversational AI systems.</li>
<li><strong>Content Generation:</strong> Agents could be used to generate text, images, or other content.</li>
<li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Agents could be used to analyze data and generate insights.</li>

Think of it as a little package of information that travels with each task or process. It contains a unique ID for the client using the system, a specific ID for the current execution, and an ID representing the overall process. These identifiers are used by different parts of the framework, like the client agent, performance tracking, and communication bus, to coordinate and monitor activity.</p>
<a id="interface-ientity" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IEntity<a href="#interface-ientity" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface, <code>IEntity</code>, serves as the foundation for all data objects that are stored and managed within the AI agent swarm. Think of it as the parent for all other entity types. When you need to represent something that the swarm needs to remember or track, it will inherit from <code>IEntity</code>, and then more specialized interfaces will add specific details about what that entity contains.</p>
<a id="interface-iembeddingschema" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IEmbeddingSchema<a href="#interface-iembeddingschema" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you define how your AI agents understand and compare information within the swarm. You can choose whether to save agent data for later use, and give your embedding method a unique name.</p>
<p>The system allows you to both store and retrieve pre-calculated embeddings to speed things up—avoiding the need to recalculate them repeatedly. You can also customize the embedding process with optional callbacks.</p>
<p>The framework provides tools to create new embeddings from text and to measure how similar two embeddings are to each other.</p>
<a id="interface-iembeddingcallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IEmbeddingCallbacks<a href="#interface-iembeddingcallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you tap into what's happening as embeddings are generated and compared. You can use it to keep track of how embeddings are being created, like logging the text used to generate them and the client associated with the request.</p>
<p>Similarly, it gives you a way to observe and potentially analyze the results of comparing two pieces of text to see how similar they are, again knowing which client requested the comparison. Think of it as a way to get notified and potentially react to the embedding process as it unfolds.</p>
<a id="interface-icustomevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface ICustomEvent<a href="#interface-icustomevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you create and send custom events within the swarm system. Think of it as a way to communicate information that doesn's fit neatly into the standard event formats. You can attach any kind of data you need to these events using the <code>payload</code> property, making it ideal for unique or specialized scenarios. It extends the basic event interface, offering greater flexibility for sharing information between different parts of the system.</p>
<a id="interface-iconfig" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IConfig<a href="#interface-iconfig" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the configuration options for generating diagrams representing relationships between different parts of a system. Specifically, the <code>withSubtree</code> property lets you control whether the diagram should include detailed, nested views of the connections, allowing for a more comprehensive visualization of the system's structure. When set to <code>true</code>, the diagram will show sub-elements and their connections, providing a more granular understanding. If set to <code>false</code>, it will show only the top-level connections.</p>
<a id="interface-icompletionschema" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface ICompletionSchema<a href="#interface-icompletionschema" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface outlines the structure for setting up how your AI agents within the swarm generate completions, or suggested actions. Each completion mechanism needs a unique name to identify it.</p>
<p>You can optionally customize what happens after a completion is generated by providing callback functions.</p>
<p>The <code>getCompletion</code> method is the core function – it's what you call to actually request a completion from the mechanism, providing the necessary context and available tools. It returns a promise that resolves with the model's response.</p>
<a id="interface-icompletioncallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface ICompletionCallbacks<a href="#interface-icompletioncallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you listen for when an AI agent completes a task.</p>
<p>Specifically, <code>onComplete</code> is a function you provide that gets called once the AI agent successfully finishes its work.</p>
<p>You can use this callback to do things like save the results, display them to a user, or start another process based on the outcome. It receives information about the task and the generated output, allowing for flexible post-processing.</p>
<a id="interface-icompletionargs" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface ICompletionArgs<a href="#interface-icompletionargs" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the information needed when asking the system to generate a response. Think of it as a package containing all the details about the request, including who's making it (identified by a client ID and agent name), the history of the conversation so far, and what kind of input it is (user or tool). It also includes a list of tools the agent might be able to use to help it formulate a response. Essentially, it's a structured way to provide context and instructions to the AI agent.</p>
<a id="interface-icompletion" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface ICompletion<a href="#interface-icompletion" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how to get responses from your AI agents. Think of it as a standard way to request and receive results, ensuring that different agents can be used consistently within your swarm. It builds upon a basic completion structure, providing a full set of tools for interacting with and getting output from your AI models.</p>
<a id="interface-iclientperfomancerecord" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IClientPerfomanceRecord<a href="#interface-iclientperfomancerecord" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface describes the performance data collected for each individual client, like a user session or agent instance, within a larger process. It’s designed to give you a detailed breakdown of how each client is performing.</p>
<p>Each client's record includes things like a unique identifier (<code>clientId</code>), the data stored within the client's session (<code>sessionMemory</code> and <code>sessionState</code>), and metrics on its execution, such as the number of times it's run (<code>executionCount</code>), the size of data it processes (<code>executionInputTotal</code>, <code>executionOutputTotal</code>), and how long its operations take (<code>executionTimeTotal</code>, <code>executionTimeAverage</code>). These records help you understand if some clients are experiencing performance bottlenecks or consuming excessive resources. Essentially, it gives you a granular view of performance at the client level.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatinstancecallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatInstanceCallbacks<a href="#interface-ichatinstancecallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines a set of callbacks that let you track the lifecycle and activity of individual chat instances within a swarm of AI agents. You can use these callbacks to monitor when a chat instance is created, when it's ready, and when it’s being shut down.</p>
<p>Specifically, you’ll receive notifications when an agent checks its activity status, when a chat session starts, and when a message is sent. The <code>onInit</code> callback gives you access to the <code>IChatInstance</code> object, allowing you to interact with the specific agent. Similarly, <code>onDispose</code> signals that the agent is being cleaned up.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatinstance" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatInstance<a href="#interface-ichatinstance" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how to interact with a single chat session within the agent swarm. You use it to start a chat, send messages to it, and receive responses. The <code>beginChat</code> method gets things rolling, while <code>sendMessage</code> lets you send content to the chat.  <code>checkLastActivity</code> helps you monitor how recently the chat has been active. When you're finished, <code>dispose</code> cleans up the chat session. Finally, <code>listenDispose</code> allows you to be notified when a chat session is being closed.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatcontrol" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatControl<a href="#interface-ichatcontrol" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This framework lets you easily swap in different chat interfaces – think of it as providing a way to plug in different &quot;chat engines.&quot; The <code>useChatAdapter</code> function allows you to specify which chat engine class the system will use.</p>
<p>You can also customize how the chat engine behaves. <code>useChatCallbacks</code> lets you define specific actions or responses that will trigger at different points during the chat process, giving you fine-grained control over its functionality.</p>
<a id="interface-ichatargs" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IChatArgs<a href="#interface-ichatargs" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the data needed to send a message to an AI agent within the system. It's a simple structure that includes a unique identifier for the application sending the message (clientId), the name of the specific agent responsible for handling the conversation (agentName), and the actual text of the message itself. Think of it as a standardized way to tell an agent, “Here's a message from this client, and you're the one who should deal with it.”</p>
<a id="interface-ibuseventcontext" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBusEventContext<a href="#interface-ibuseventcontext" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface provides extra information about events happening within the AI agent swarm. Think of it as a way to tag events with details about which agent, swarm, storage, state, or policy is involved.</p>
<p>While a client agent typically only uses the <code>agentName</code> field to specify which agent triggered the event, other parts of the system might use the other fields like <code>swarmName</code>, <code>storageName</code>, <code>stateName</code>, or <code>policyName</code> to provide more context for different kinds of events. For example, a swarm-level event might use <code>swarmName</code> to indicate which swarm is involved, or a policy enforcement event might use <code>policyName</code> to identify the policy being applied. It’s a structured way to add clarity and traceability to events across the entire system.</p>
<a id="interface-ibusevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBusEvent<a href="#interface-ibusevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface describes the structure of messages sent across the system's internal communication channels. Think of it as a standardized way for different parts of the system, particularly agents, to talk to each other and notify the core system about what's happening. Each message contains information about where it came from (the source), what kind of action it represents (the type), any data being sent along with it (input), any results from that action (output), and some extra information about the context of the message (context). Agents use this structure to share details about their actions, like running a function, sending a user message, or reporting the result of a tool execution.</p>
<a id="interface-ibus" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBus<a href="#interface-ibus" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>The <code>IBus</code> interface provides a way for different parts of the AI agent swarm to communicate with each other, particularly to notify clients about what's happening. Think of it as a central messaging system.</p>
<p>Agents use the <code>emit</code> method to send structured events to specific clients. These events contain information about actions like completing a task, producing output, or committing data. The events follow a consistent format, including details about the event type, where it came from, any input data, any output results, and the client it's intended for.</p>
<p>This system ensures that clients are kept up-to-date with what agents are doing, and that communication between components is handled in a reliable and organized manner. It's like a broadcast system, but targeted at specific clients, allowing for a coordinated and transparent workflow within the AI swarm. The <code>clientId</code> is included in the event for extra confirmation and filtering.</p>
<a id="interface-ibaseevent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IBaseEvent<a href="#interface-ibaseevent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface sets up the basic building blocks for all events happening within the system, like messages passed between agents. Every event will have a <code>source</code>, which tells you where the event came from – like a specific agent or a core system component. It also includes a <code>clientId</code>, which ensures the event reaches the right client or agent instance. Think of it as providing the “who” and “where” information for every action happening within the swarm.</p>
<a id="interface-iagenttoolcallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentToolCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagenttoolcallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you customize how tools within your AI agent swarm behave. You can hook into different stages of a tool's lifecycle to add extra functionality.</p>
<p>For example, <code>onBeforeCall</code> lets you do things like log what's about to happen or prepare data before a tool runs. <code>onAfterCall</code> is your chance to clean up or record the results afterward.</p>
<p><code>onValidate</code> provides a way to check if a tool’s inputs are correct before it even starts. And finally, <code>onCallError</code> helps you handle any issues that might arise during tool execution. Essentially, it’s a way to add layers of control and monitoring to your agent tools.</p>
<a id="interface-iagenttool" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentTool<a href="#interface-iagenttool" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface, <code>IAgentTool</code>, describes a specific tool that an AI agent can use within a larger group of agents. Each tool has a name to identify it, and an optional description to help users understand how it works.</p>
<p>Before a tool runs, the <code>validate</code> function checks if the provided input is correct. You can customize the tool's behavior even further using optional lifecycle callbacks.</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>call</code> function is how you actually run the tool, giving it the parameters and context it needs to perform its task.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschemacallbacks" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchemaCallbacks<a href="#interface-iagentschemacallbacks" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface lets you tap into key moments in an agent's lifecycle. You can use these callbacks to monitor what's happening, react to events, or even customize the agent's behavior.</p>
<p>For example, you can listen for when an agent starts running (<code>onRun</code>, <code>onExecute</code>), when a tool finishes generating a response (<code>onToolOutput</code>), or when a user sends a message (<code>onUserMessage</code>).</p>
<p>You also have hooks for managing the agent's state, like flushing its history (<code>onFlush</code>) or restoring it after a disruption (<code>onResurrect</code>), and for tracking its initialization and disposal (<code>onInit</code>, <code>onDispose</code>). Lastly, there’s a callback (<code>onAfterToolCalls</code>) to know when a series of tool calls has completed.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentschema" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentSchema<a href="#interface-iagentschema" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines how an agent is configured within the swarm. Think of it as a blueprint that specifies everything about an agent, from its name and the prompt it uses, to the tools it can access and how its output is handled.</p>
<p>You can customize an agent by providing descriptions for documentation or limiting the number of tools it can use in a cycle. The <code>agentName</code> property is crucial for identifying each agent uniquely.</p>
<p>It also lets you control how the agent interacts with other components, like mapping messages or validating outputs. If an agent needs to rely on another agent for certain operations, you can define a dependency using <code>dependsOn</code>. Finally, you have the flexibility to add custom actions using callbacks to tailor the agent's behavior to specific needs.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentparams" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentParams<a href="#interface-iagentparams" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface defines the information needed to run an individual agent within the larger AI agent swarm. Think of it as a configuration package that tells the agent how to operate, who it’s working for (clientId), and provides it with tools for communication and record-keeping.  It includes a logger for tracking activity, a bus for sending messages around the swarm, a history tracker, and a mechanism for generating responses. You can also provide the agent with a list of tools it can use, and a validation step to check its output before it’s finalized.</p>
<a id="interface-iagentconnectionservice" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgentConnectionService<a href="#interface-iagentconnectionservice" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface helps define how different AI agents connect and communicate within the system. Think of it as a blueprint that ensures the publicly accessible parts of the connection service are consistent and predictable. It's designed to strip away any internal workings, so only the essential connection details are exposed for external use, keeping things clean and organized.</p>
<a id="interface-iagent" class="tsd-anchor"></a><h2 class="tsd-anchor-link">Interface IAgent<a href="#interface-iagent" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h2><p>This interface describes how you interact with an individual agent within the system. Think of it as a blueprint for how an agent functions.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>run</code> method to quickly test an agent with some input without affecting its memory or past interactions. The <code>execute</code> method is the main way to make an agent work, potentially changing its memory based on the chosen mode.</p>
<p>To get the agent's final result, use <code>waitForOutput</code>.</p>
<p>Beyond simply running the agent, you have methods for managing its internal state. These allow you to manually add messages – system prompts, user inputs, and assistant responses – without triggering a full response cycle. You can even clear the agent’s entire history with <code>commitFlush</code> or temporarily halt tool execution with <code>commitStopTools</code> and <code>commitAgentChange</code>.</p>
